According to the limited literature, @DISEASE$ utilizes @GENE$ as its receptor and causes severe hypoxemia.	1
Finally, unbiased computational ligand docking indicates that heparan sulfate interacts with the GAG-binding motif at the S1/S2 site on each monomer interface in the trimeric @DISEASE$ @GENE$, and at another site (453-459 (YRLFRKS)) when the receptor-binding domain is in an open conformation.	1
Optimal utilization of @GENE$ imaging during @DISEASE$.	1
