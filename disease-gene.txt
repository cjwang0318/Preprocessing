85	The rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines during the '@DISEASE$' induce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), leading to an increase in kynurenine that activates the @GENE$, thereby heightening the initial pro-inflammatory cytokine phase and suppressing the endogenous anti-viral response.	1

224	@GENE$ as a Target for @DISEASE$ Treatment: Suggested Effects of Azithromycin and Stem Cell Engagement.	1
225	In this communication, we aimed to evaluate the significance of @GENE$ and the potential protective effect of melatonin that is mediated by this protein in @DISEASE$.	1
226	In the present paper, it is proposed that OSCC, by the virtue of upregulation of @GENE$ expression, increases the susceptibility to coronavirus disease (@DISEASE$).	1
227	@GENE$, a receptor on host cells, is a novel route for @DISEASE$ invasion.	1
228	In addition to the possible effect in invasion, azithromycin decreases the expression of some metalloproteinases (downstream to @GENE$), induces anti-viral responses in primary human bronchial epithelial infected with @DISEASE$, decreasing viral replication and release.	1
229	Studies suggest beneficial effects of azithromycin in reducing viral load of hospitalized patients, possibly interfering with ligand/@GENE$ interactions; however, its possible effects on @DISEASE$ invasion has not yet been evaluated.	1
230	Some other routes of entry of @DISEASE$ are also mentioned (e.g., @GENE$); however, these findings are not structurally validated.	1
231	@GENE$ is a glycoprotein that is responsible for the @DISEASE$ in the lungs through the mediation of viral invasion.	1
232	Since one of the routes of entry for the virus is the oral cavity, it becomes imperative to percept oral comorbidities such oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) in terms of @GENE$ as a target for @DISEASE$.	1
233	Inhibition of @GENE$ in patients with severe @DISEASE$.	1
234	These results suggest that targeting excessive host inflammation with a @GENE$ inhibitor is a therapeutic strategy in severe @DISEASE$ and has led to a confirmatory international prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.	1
235	Acalabrutinib, a selective @GENE$ inhibitor, was administered off-label to 19 patients hospitalized with severe @DISEASE$ (11 on supplemental oxygen; 8 on mechanical ventilation), 18 of whom had increasing oxygen requirements at baseline.	1
236	These attempts, however, did not consider potential off target effect of @GENE$ inhibitors on T cell differentiation, function, and survival, which may be beneficial in treatment for @DISEASE$.	1
237	The @GENE$ inhibitor ibrutinib may protect against pulmonary injury in @DISEASE$-infected patients.	1
238	By modulating key transcription factors, @GENE$ may regulate macrophage polarization downstream of classic M1 and M2 polarizing stimuli and mitigate the hyperinflammatory state associated with @DISEASE$.	1
239	Separately, the molecular detection of @DISEASE$ was completed from different transport mediums (DMEM, @GENE$, 100 % ethanol, 0.9 % normal saline and VTM), which were kept up to three days at room temperature (RT).	1
240	While the lopinavir-ritonavir-, hydroxychloroquine sulfate-, or emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group exhibited lower overall clinical scores than the phosphate-buffered saline (@DISEASE$)-treated control group, the virus titers in nasal washes, stool specimens, and respiratory tissues were similar between all three antiviral-candidate-treated groups and the @GENE$-treated control group.	1
241	@GENE$ and the contact system in @DISEASE$.	1
242	Is there relationship between @DISEASE$ and the @GENE$ and C4?	1
243	@GENE$ is a subclone of the human @DISEASE$ HepG2 cell line with strong contact inhibition of growth.	1

250	However, excess @GENE$ can result in a pro-inflammatory environment orchestrated through a plethora of mechanisms that propagate lung injury, lymphocyte exhaustion, and an immune @DISEASE$.	1
251	The main evolved gases were C4-C24 alkenes and dienes for @DISEASE$ and C6-C41 alkanes and @GENE$41 alkenes for MB.	1
252	The @DISEASE$ has resulted in an international shortage of personal protective equipment including N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), resulting in many institutions using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) technology for N95 @GENE$ decontamination.	1
253	Four different locations (facepiece and strap) on 5 different N95 @GENE$ models (3 M 1860, 8210, 8511, 9211; Moldex 1511) were inoculated with a 10 Î¼L drop of @DISEASE$ viral stock (8 Ã 107 TCID50/mL).	1
254	We carried out a rapid review to summarize the existing literature on the viability of @DISEASE$, the efficacy of key potential disinfection procedures against the virus (specifically ultraviolet light and heat), and the impact of these procedures on @GENE$ performance, material integrity, and/or fit.	1
255	To develop and test a new reusable, sterilisable N95 filtering facepiece respirator (@GENE$)-comparable face mask, known as the Injection Molded Autoclavable, Scalable, Conformable (iMASC) system, given the dire need for personal protective equipment within healthcare settings during the @DISEASE$.	1
256	Here we report the isolation of two specific human monoclonal antibodies (termed @GENE$ and CB6) from a patient convalescing from @DISEASE$.	1
257	@GENE$ and CB6 demonstrated potent @DISEASE$-specific neutralization activity in vitro.	1
258	Patients with @DISEASE$ also had significantly higher inpatient mortality (31% vs 20%, P = 0.046) and need for renal replacement therapy (33% vs 11%, P &lt; 0.0001) compared to the non-@GENE$ group.	1
259	Also, @DISEASE$ cohort displayed higher white blood cell counts and @GENE$ values.	1
260	Could @GENE$ Antagonists Be Helpful in the Fight Against @DISEASE$?	1
261	We collected information on the opinions of scientific societies and medicines agencies (American, European, and Spanish) to clarify doubts regarding the use of drugs such as lisinopril, candesartan, ibuprofen, corticosteroids, carbamazepine, and monoclonal antibodies targeting the @GENE$-related peptide in the context of the @DISEASE$.	1

263	@GENE$ 2020, @DISEASE$ and Beyond.	1
264	Methods - To provide data regarding any potential fetal/neonatal cardiotoxicity, we leveraged a unique opportunity in which neonatal electrocardiograms (ECGs) and HCQ blood levels were available in a recently completed study evaluating the efficacy of HCQ 400mg daily to prevent the recurrence of @DISEASE$ associated with anti-@GENE$/Ro antibodies.	1
265	While vitamin D influences transcription of many immune related genes, the weakened antimicrobial response of those with VDD against @DISEASE$ may be in part due to reduced @GENE$.	1
266	@GENE$ also modulates cytokine signaling at the site of @DISEASE$.	1
267	While vitamin D influences transcription of many immune related genes, the weakened antimicrobial response of those with VDD against @DISEASE$ may be in part due to reduced @GENE$.	1
268	However, the role of @GENE$/11 in the recovery of muscle from ischemia caused by @DISEASE$ is unknown.	1
269	C57Bl/6 J (WT) and @GENE$/11 double-knockout (KO) mice underwent femoral artery ligation (a model of hind-@DISEASE$) with or without CQ (50 mg/kg IP every 2nd day).	1
270	@GENE$ assists to regulate production of cytokines, protect oxidative injury, and repress replication of @DISEASE$, as demonstrated in human leukocytes and alveolar epithelial cells, and rhesus macaques, without noticeable toxicity.	1
271	Herein it is a therapeutic based on @GENE$, an antioxidant enzyme that can effectively breakdown hydrogen peroxide and minimize the downstream reactive oxygen species, which are excessively produced resulting from the @DISEASE$ and inflammatory process, is reported.	1
272	Since the physiological @GENE$ deficiency appears to prevent acute cell damage treatment algorithms could potentially be developed to block this pathway in the non-pregnant population affected by @DISEASE$.	1
273	The presence of more than one @GENE$ binding sites on coronavirus is an important finding supporting the possible relationship between @DISEASE$-mediated lung injury.	1
274	Rapid determination and optimisation of berberine from Himalayan Berberis lycium by soxhlet apparatus using @GENE$-RSM and its quality control as a potential candidate for @DISEASE$.	1
275	A structured questionnaire and Clinical @DISEASE$ Rating Scale (@GENE$)-FTD were used by the neurologist with patients and/or caregivers.	1
276	Our results indicate that inflammatory transitional and non-classical monocytes and @GENE$+ conventional dendritic cells preferentially migrate from blood to lungs in patients with severe @DISEASE$.	1
277	@DISEASE$ severity associates with pulmonary redistribution of @GENE$+ DC and inflammatory transitional and nonclassical monocytes.	1
278	@DISEASE$ reactive @GENE$+ T cells have been reported in unexposed individuals, suggesting pre-existing cross-reactive T cell memory in 20-50% of people.	1
279	PWH with Covid-19 demonstrated severe @DISEASE$ and decreased @GENE$+ T cell counts.	1
280	Together, our study demonstrated close connection between @GENE$+ T cells and antibody production in @DISEASE$ convalescents.	1
281	Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only the @GENE$+ cell counts were significantly lower in the @DISEASE$ group and slightly higher in the control group.	1
282	The age-LDH-@GENE$ â¥ 82 has high sensitive (81%) and specific (93%) for the early identification of @DISEASE$ patients with severe progression tendency.	1
283	All had HIV viral load &lt;200 copies/mL and were on antiretroviral therapy with @GENE$ count range 87 to 1441 cells/ÂµL. Twenty-six of the 27 had common @DISEASE$ symptoms for one to twenty-eight days and most had other co-morbidities and/or risk factors.	1
284	Based on the recognized harmful effects of these @GENE$+ T-cell subset imbalances in pregnancy, we speculated that @DISEASE$ might lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes through the deregulation of otherwise tightly regulated Treg/Th17 ratios, and to subsequent uncontrolled systemic inflammation.	1
285	Most of @DISEASE$ were @GENE$-positive T cells.	1
286	Factors significantly (P&lt;0.05) associated with death included age and number of co-morbidities, while time from @DISEASE$ and lower current @GENE$ counts were significant only in univariate analysis.	1
287	The decreased T cell proportions were observed in @DISEASE$ patients especially in severe cases, and all elevated to normal in mild patiens after initial treatment but only @GENE$+T cells return to normal in severe cases.	1
288	Lastly, influx of @GENE$+ T-cells in cardiac vasculature results in an increased production of cytokines that stimulate smooth muscle cells to migrate into the intima and generate collagen and other fibrous products leading to advancement of fatty streaks to advanced @DISEASE$.	1
289	Estradiol is connected with @GENE$+ T cell numbers and increases T-reg cell populations, affecting immune responses to @DISEASE$.	1
290	Neutrophil to @GENE$+ lymphocyte ratio as a potential biomarker in predicting virus negative conversion time in @DISEASE$.	1
291	Mild Cytokine Elevation, Moderate @GENE$+âT Cell Response and Abundant Antibody Production in Children with @DISEASE$.	1
292	Alterations in genes involved in hyaluronan, glycosaminoglycan and mucopolysaccharides metabolism were over-represented in bronchoalveolar cells infected by @DISEASE$, as well as potential lung infiltration with neutrophils, T @GENE$+ cell and macrophages.	1
293	Peripheral @GENE$+ T cell subsets and antibody response in @DISEASE$ convalescent individuals.	1
294	However, @GENE$+ T cell population that is critical for antibody response in @DISEASE$ is poorly understood.	1
295	The multivariable analysis identified age (OR = 1.061, p = 0.028), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR = 1.006, p = 0.037), and @GENE$ count (OR = 0.993, p = 0.006) as the independent predictors of @DISEASE$ progression.	1
296	All were taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) with @GENE$ count &gt;200 cells/mm3 and suppressed HIV viral loads at the time of @DISEASE$ diagnosis.	1
297	@DISEASE$ RT-PCR remained positive after a median of 40 days from symptoms onset in six (32%) individuals, four of whom had severe disease or low nadir @GENE$ cell counts.	1
298	Interestingly, the @GENE$ expression was upregulated in Î³Î´ T cells reflecting the occurrence of a specific effector cell population, which may serve as a biomarker for the assessment of @DISEASE$.	1
299	The age-LDH-@GENE$ model is a simple algorithm for early identifying patients with severe progression tendency following @DISEASE$, and warrants further validation.	1
300	A peripheral flow cyometry evidenced a @GENE$ negative @DISEASE$.	1
301	Itolizumab, an anti-@GENE$ monoclonal antibody, as a potential treatment for @DISEASE$ complications.	1
302	Although information about the mechanisms of immunity are scant, it appears that monocyte/macrophages and then @GENE$ T cells are important in eliminating the @DISEASE$ virus.	1
303	Priming with appropriate vaccines may thus be beneficial for optimizing @GENE$+ T cell immunity in @DISEASE$.	1
304	CONCLUSIONIL-6 (&gt;20 pg/mL) and @GENE$+ T cell counts (&lt;165 cells/Î¼L) are 2 reliable prognostic indicators that accurately stratify patients into risk categories and predict @DISEASE$ mortality.	1
305	We noted that mortality in sham-treated mice corresponded with @GENE$+ T cell @DISEASE$ on days 11-12 after virus challenge, after the viral burden had declined.	1
306	Stimulation of local innate immunity within the lungs by TLR agonists early in disease or suppression of adaptive immunity by systemic @GENE$+ T cell depletion late in disease improves outcomes of @DISEASE$ in mice.	1
307	Multivariate analysis with covariables adjusted results showed that the count of @GENE$+ T cells (HR=2.376, p=0.114) was a predominant risk factor for the @DISEASE$ viral positivity duration.	1
308	Shared @GENE$+ T cell receptors for @DISEASE$.	1
309	We aim to investigate the immune status of @GENE$+ T and NK cells in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
310	Here we provide the first description of the pathomorphological changes in adrenal glands in patients with severe @DISEASE$ characterized by perivascular infiltration of CD3+ and @GENE$+ T-lymphocytes.	1
311	Moreover, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (AUC=0Â·93) and neutrophil-to-@GENE$+ T cell ratio (N8R) (AUC =0Â·94) were identified as powerful prognostic factors affecting the prognosis for severe @DISEASE$.	1
312	A high @GENE$/Treg/monocyte ratio predicted a severe disease course in @DISEASE$ patients, and was associated with high serum levels of antiviral cytokines.	1
313	In mild cases, higher proportions of @DISEASE$-specific @GENE$+ T cells were observed.	1
314	Moreover, tissue-resident @GENE$+ T cells and inflammatory NK cells are significantly more abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from mildly affected @DISEASE$ patients compared to severe cases.	1
315	Furthermore, these subpopulations and their association with antiviral effector @GENE$+ T cell subsets were also characterized in lung infiltrates from critical @DISEASE$ patients.	1
316	We also confirm that our binding predictors can predict epitopes eliciting @GENE$+ T cell responses from multiple @DISEASE$ proteins.	1
317	Our findings firstly provided early laboratory parameters such as count of @GENE$+ T cells, as risk factors for the duration of @DISEASE$ viral positivity, which have significance in control and prevention of the disease.	1
318	Increased expression of @GENE$ on T-cells in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
319	RESULTSPatients with @DISEASE$ showed decreased numbers of circulating T, B, and NK cells and exhibited a skewing of @GENE$+ T cells toward a terminally differentiated/senescent phenotype.	1
320	We documented lymphocyte depletion (particularly @GENE$-positive T cells) in haematological organs and @DISEASE$.	1
321	@GENE$+ T cells tended to be an independent predictor for @DISEASE$ severity and treatment efficacy.	1
322	@DISEASE$-specific @GENE$+ T cells were predominantly Temra cells in a state of less terminal differentiation than most Temra cells.	1
323	In addition, the role of @GENE$+ T cells present in the lung of @DISEASE$ patients and relevant for viral control has not been characterized.	1
324	@GENE$+ T cells remember same bits of @DISEASE$.	1
325	This is based on two key observations, that GSK-3 inhibitors can simultaneously block @DISEASE$ viral replication, while boosting @GENE$+ adaptive T-cell and innate natural killer (NK) responses.	1
326	Secondly, we and others have previously documented that GSK-3 SMIs markedly enhance @GENE$+ cytolytic T-cell (CTL) and NK cell anti-viral effector functions leading to a reduction in both acute and chronic @DISEASE$ in mice.	1
327	For @GENE$+ T cells, spike and M were recognized, with at least eight @DISEASE$ ORFs targeted.	1
328	Targeting innate immunity by blocking @GENE$: Novel approach to control inflammation and organ dysfunction in @DISEASE$ illness.	1
329	@DISEASE$ RNAemia peaked several days later, followed by a seroconversion despite the absence of circulating @GENE$-positive lymphocytes at admission due to rituximab-based treatment of antibody-mediated rejection 3 months earlier.	1
330	As they are, in general, associated with a higher risk of @DISEASE$, depleting anti-@GENE$ antibodies may be problematic drugs.	1
331	Could anti-@GENE$ therapy jeopardise the efficacy of a @DISEASE$ vaccine?	1
332	Therapeutic Potential of @GENE$a Cells in @DISEASE$.	1
333	Avoid the use of antimetabolics and anti-@GENE$ in patients with Covid-19, as they reduce viral clearance and predispose to @DISEASE$.	1
334	One group of such immunosuppressants used in @DISEASE$ comprises the anti-@GENE$ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) ocrelizumab and rituximab.	1
335	MRI scan of his whole spine demonstrated hyperintense T2 signal centrally from T7 to @GENE$, suggestive of @DISEASE$.	1
336	Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines, including those found in the plasma of @DISEASE$ patients, upregulated @GENE$ on uninfected dendritic cells, thereby linking innate modulation with downstream adaptive immune responses.	1
337	Aspergillus penicillioides @DISEASE$ was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing and @GENE$ analysis.	1
338	@GENE$ and clustalW were used to identify and align viral sequences of @DISEASE$ to other animal coronaviruses (human, bat, mouse, pangolin) and related artificial constructs.	1
339	Whole genome analysis and alignment carried out using BLASTn, SMART @GENE$ and WebDSV 2.0 had shown more than 238 ORF's coding for proteins mostly origin from Bat @DISEASE$ and root genomic origin from Archaea.	1
340	@GENE$ analysis confirmed that this fragment is conserved only in the human and bat @DISEASE$ strains.	1
341	While more @GENE$(+) cells were found in the medullary sinuses of 1 case (related to @DISEASE$).	1
342	Finally, expression of the @GENE$ activation marker on blood iNKT and MAIT cells of @DISEASE$ patients on admission was predictive of clinical course and disease severity.	1
343	CIITA induces resistance by activating expression of the p41 isoform of invariant chain @GENE$, which inhibits viral entry by blocking cathepsin-mediated processing of the @DISEASE$ glycoprotein (EboGP).	1
344	We further show that @GENE$ p41 can block the endosomal entry pathway of coronaviruses, including @DISEASE$.	1
345	Public loyalty to precautionary measures is affected by their knowledge, attitude, risk factors and practices (@GENE$) towards @DISEASE$.	1
346	We sought to understand if: a) demographic variables of Cameroonian residents could influence KAP and symptomatology, and b) KAP could influence the risk of having @DISEASE$.A cross-sectional @GENE$/symptomatology online survey was conducted between April 20 to May 20.	1
347	Conclusion: The residents in Anhui province have a good @GENE$ about @DISEASE$, yet it is necessary to strengthen the community publicity, the mental health maintenance of residents and students' health education.	1

367	While the lopinavir-ritonavir-, hydroxychloroquine sulfate-, or emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group exhibited lower overall clinical scores than the phosphate-buffered saline (@DISEASE$)-treated control group, the virus titers in nasal washes, stool specimens, and respiratory tissues were similar between all three antiviral-candidate-treated groups and the @GENE$-treated control group.	1
368	In this study, we present a viral-associated disease-specific chemogenomics knowledgebase (Virus-@GENE$) and apply our computational systems pharmacology-target mapping to rapidly predict the FDA-approved drugs which can quickly progress into clinical trials to meet the urgent demand of the @DISEASE$ outbreak.	1

389	The majority of patients had @DISEASE$, elevated liver function tests and @GENE$.	1
390	Elevated levels of @GENE$, d-dimer, and troponin were found in 100%, 91%, and 71% of the patients, respectively; 62% received vasopressor support, 53% had evidence of @DISEASE$, 80% were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 2 died.	1
391	COVID19 patients had significantly lower mean white blood cells, neutrophils, platelet count, and pCT values, and significantly higher @GENE$, LDH, and ferritin levels than non-@DISEASE$ patients.	1
392	Lactate dehydrogenase and @GENE$ as predictors of @DISEASE$ in CoVID-19 patients.	1
393	Moreover, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of @DISEASE$ and an elevation of @GENE$.	1
394	Moreover, the longitudinal changes of serum cytokines, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity @GENE$ (hsCRP), and hsCRP to lymphocyte count ratio (hsCRP/L) as well as their associations with disease severity and outcomes were investigated in 68 @DISEASE$ patients.	1
395	Laboratory findings were described in a lower number of patients and revealed @DISEASE$ (0.93 Ã 109/L, 95% CI 0.83-1.03 Ã 109/L, n = 464) and abnormal @GENE$ (33.72 mg/dL, 95% CI 21.54-45.91 mg/dL; n = 1637).	1
396	Detectable viral RNA in anal swabs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-5.24), increased @GENE$ (aHR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.35-7.32) and @DISEASE$ (aHR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.46-6.67) were independently associated with ICU admission.	1
397	Furthermore, potential risk factors for developing GI symptoms, male gender, and increased @GENE$ can help clinicians predict clinical outcomes in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
398	Patients with elevated @GENE$ levels, @DISEASE$, or elevated LDH require proper management and, if necessary, transfer to the intensive care unit.	1
399	History of acute rejection during the past 12 months, @DISEASE$, higher N/L ratio, lower platelet count, elevated N/L x @GENE$, higher levels of LDH, positive D-dimer, higher troponin, and prolonged PT were associated with mortality.	1
400	@DISEASE$ and increased levels of WBCs along with elevated @GENE$ were associated with increased risk of death.	1
401	After the 2-day interruption in apheresis, @GENE$ levels rapidly re-increased (&gt;400 mg/L) and the patient developed laboratory signs of multi-@DISEASE$.	1
402	Their laboratory results showed @DISEASE$ and increased levels of @GENE$ and D-dimer.	1
403	Most patients showed normal leucocytes counts, @DISEASE$, elevated levels of @GENE$ and ESR.	1
404	We present two @DISEASE$ patients in whom pulmonary embolism was suspected (and diagnosed) due to a discrepancy between an increase in D-dimer blood levels and a decrease in @GENE$ blood levels over time.	1
405	In a multivariable logistic regression, age, @DISEASE$, @GENE$ at admission and Peak NLR were significantly associated with death.	1
406	Plasma @GENE$ level is positively associated with the severity of @DISEASE$.	1
407	Patients who maintained increased oxygenation had increased levels of inflammatory markers (@GENE$: 12Â·7 mg/L [SD 6Â·9] in responders vs 8Â·4 mg/L [6Â·2] in non-responders; and platelets: 241Â·1 Ã 103/Î¼L [101Â·9] vs 319Â·8 Ã 103/Î¼L [120Â·6]) and shorter time between admission to hospital and prone positioning (2Â·7 days [@DISEASE$Â·1] in responders vs 4Â·6 days [3Â·7] in non-responders) than did those for whom improved oxygenation was not maintained.	1
408	The receiver-operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of @GENE$ on the first visit for predicting severe @DISEASE$ was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10-1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut-off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.	1
409	At multivariate analysis, risk factors for SRF in the derivation cohort assessed at hospitalization were age â¥70 years (OR 2.74; 95% CI 1.66-4.50), @DISEASE$ (OR 4.62; 95% CI 2.78-7.70), body temperature â¥38Â°C (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.30-2.29), respiratory rate â¥22 breaths/min (OR 3.75; 95% CI 2.01-7.01), lymphocytes â¤900 cells/mm3 (OR 2.69; 95% CI 1.60-4.51), creatinine â¥1 mg/dL (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.59-3.56), @GENE$ â¥10 mg/dL (OR 5.91; 95% CI 4.88-7.17) and lactate dehydrogenase â¥350 IU/L (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.11-5.11).	1
410	Machine learning analysis revealed that the most important features in death classification were @DISEASE$, elevated @GENE$ and advanced age.	1
411	Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.08, 95 % CI 1.48-2.92 per ten years more) and @DISEASE$ (aHR 3.04, 95 % CI 1.42-6.49) were independently associated with an increased risk of death, which was also associated with critical disease (aHR 8.26, 95 % CI 1.41-48.29), @GENE$ levels (aHR 1.17, 95 % CI 1.02-1.35 per 50 mg/L more) and creatinine kinase levels above 185 U/L (aHR 2.58, 95 % CI 1.37-4.87) upon admission.	1
412	The predictive value of serum amyloid A and @GENE$ levels for the severity of @DISEASE$.	1
413	According to the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the combined predictive probability of @GENE$ and SAA levels, along with white blood cell count, showed the highest area under the curve (AUC; 0.878), and was able to distinguish between patients with and without @DISEASE$.	1
414	In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood decreased in 2 cases (6%), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6%), and the @DISEASE$ in 2 cases (6%).Elevation of @GENE$ (10%, 3/30), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (19%, 4/21), procalcitonin (4%,1/28), liver enzyme (22%, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15%, 4/27) occurred in different proportions.	1
415	@GENE$/LYM is a highly sensitive indicator to assess the severity of @DISEASE$ in the early stage of disease.	1
416	It was found that 96.8% and 72.4% of patients present with @GENE$ level and @DISEASE$, respectively, and 70.6% of kidney recipients patients presented with high creatinine levels.	1
417	On laboratory evaluation, many patients present with @DISEASE$ and increased @GENE$, which are both associated with inferior outcomes.	1
418	The commonest laboratory abnormalities were raised @GENE$ or procalcitonin (54.0%), @DISEASE$ (34.2%) and elevated transaminases (16.0%).	1
419	Further, the @DISEASE$ patients whose illness entered 7-10 days, age &gt; 50 years, and elevated @GENE$ levels should be given additional medical considerations.	1
420	An high @GENE$ value and abnormalities of chest X-ray (@DISEASE$) were detected in 26.2% and 19% of patients, respectively.	1
421	However, @GENE$ could not predict the recovery of @DISEASE$.	1
422	Mortality was associated with those that were admitted to ICU (19% vs 0; p=0.009), mechanically ventilated (31% vs 0; p=0.001), had @DISEASE$ (20% vs 2.3%; p=0.032), older (62 vs 47 years; p=0.045), had high total bilirubin (43% vs 2.3%; p=0.007) and those with high @GENE$ (186 vs 90mg/dL; p=0.009) and low corrected calcium (15% vs 0%; p=0.047).	1
423	Insights into @GENE$ structure-function relationships have uncovered both pro- and anti-inflammatory isoforms that may be used to monitor the extent of tissue damage associated with @DISEASE$ pathologies and prognoses.	1
424	Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts, elevated levels of @GENE$ and @DISEASE$, confirming the viral origin of the disease.	1
425	@DISEASE$ (&lt;1.0 Ã 10 cells/L) was identified in 6 of 10 patients, 9 of 9 patients had a high serum level of D-dimer, and 9 of 9 patients had a high level of @GENE$.	1
426	A higher proportion of PLH group needed inpatient services (19.31% vs 11.39%, RR 1.696, 95% CI: 1.21 - 2.38).Mean @GENE$, ferritin, ESR and LDH levels after @DISEASE$ diagnosis were not statistically different and mortality was not different for PLH with history of anti-retroviral treatment.	1
427	Thombocytosis, @DISEASE$, and increased @GENE$ were common lab findings although most patients included in the overall analysis did not have laboratory values reported.	1
428	As the worsening of severity, the positive rates of @GENE$ and @DISEASE$ also showed trends of increase.	1
429	Different @GENE$/@DISEASE$ type showed associations with viral loads in patients in different severity and different time after onset.	1
430	Most of them had several comorbidities, and all had multiple biological abnormalities (@DISEASE$, increased @GENE$, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, liver enzymes).	1
431	ROC curves showed a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 70% for the LDH cut-off value of 450 U/L and a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 71% for the @GENE$ cut-off value of 11 mg/dl in identifying CoVID-19 with moderate-severe @DISEASE$.	1
432	The pooled area under the @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ curves were 0.70 (0.64-0.76) and 0.89 (0.80-0.99), respectively.	1
433	There was an important gain in oxygenation (P/F 300), a decrease of @GENE$ values, and a decrease of the @DISEASE$.	1
434	Compared with the common type, there was significant difference in the white blood cell and lymphocyte counts in the severe type (P&lt;0.01); the @DISEASE$ indicators, such as hypersensitivity @GENE$ and serum ferritin, were significantly increased, with significant difference (all P&lt;0.01); but the procalcitonin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was not significantly different (both P&gt;0.05).	1
435	At baseline, all patients had multiple biological abnormalities (@DISEASE$, increased @GENE$, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer and liver enzymes).	1
436	Multivariable regression demonstrated increasing odds of severity associated with the duration of @DISEASE$ (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.10-1.82, per day increase; p=0Â·007), @GENE$ (1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52; p=0.02), and PO2 &lt;80 mmHg (28.07, 95% CI 1.50-524.12; p=0.026) on admission.	1
437	First-in-Man: Case Report of Selective @GENE$ Apheresis in a Patient with @DISEASE$.	1
438	CONCLUSIONS This is the first report on @GENE$ apheresis in a @DISEASE$ patient.	1
439	The signature of @DISEASE$ was combined with five indicators, namely neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin, older age, and @GENE$.	1
440	Males were more likely to have liver injury when infected with @DISEASE$ (P &lt; .05); compared with patients without liver injury, patients with liver injury had increased levels of white blood cell counts, neutrophils, @GENE$ and CT score (P &lt; .05) and had a longer length of stay (P &lt; .05).	1
441	Mild patients had low to moderate @DISEASE$ (&lt;39.1 Â°C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased @GENE$.	1
442	The levels of @GENE$ and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest a typical @DISEASE$.	1
443	We aimed to assess the usefulness of @GENE$ levels in the early stage of @DISEASE$ and to correlate them with lung lesions and severe presentation.	1
444	In the early stage of @DISEASE$ @GENE$ levels were positively correlated with lung lesions and could reflect disease severity.	1
445	Abnormal white blood cell counts have poor sensitivity for @DISEASE$; procalcitonin and @GENE$ levels, when available, are more informative.	1
446	The aim of the present study was to estimate whether the @GENE$ level is able to act as a marker in indicating the severity of @DISEASE$.	1
447	@GENE$, procalcitonin, d-dimer, and @DISEASE$-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients.	1
448	In regard to the hematological parameters, @DISEASE$ patients showed decreased erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, and complement C1q, whereas neutrophils, @GENE$, and procalcitonin were significantly increased, especially in severe cases.	1
449	Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and @GENE$ were found in postpartum blood tests of @DISEASE$ patients.	1
450	Kinetics of temperature, @GENE$, and lymphocyte counts mirrored the remitting/relapsing @DISEASE$.	1
451	On admission, the levels of SpO2, lymphocyte, @GENE$, PCT, and LDH could predict the prognosis of severe @DISEASE$ patients.	1
452	During the second episode, there was serological evidence of elevated @GENE$ and @DISEASE$ IgG seroconversion.	1
453	Levels of @GENE$, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = 0.37, P = 0.003, Spearman's correlation) of patients who presented @DISEASE$.	1
454	Moreover, the change of @GENE$ level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of @DISEASE$.	1
455	Among the survivors versus non-survivors of @DISEASE$, there were significant differences in total leukocyte count (p&lt;0.001), neutrophil count, (p&lt;0.001), lymphocyte count (p&lt;0.001), urea (p&lt;0.001), serum bicarbonate (p=0.001), @GENE$ levels (p&lt;0.001), LDH (p=0.013), and D-dimer (p&lt;0.001) at admission.	1
456	In patients with @DISEASE$, admission @GENE$ correlated with disease severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse outcome.	1
457	The main laboratory findings were @DISEASE$ (33%) and elevated D-dimer (52%) and @GENE$ (40%) levels.	1
458	The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated @GENE$ (68.6% [58.2-78.2]), @DISEASE$ count (57.4% [44.8-69.5]) and increased lactate dehydrogenase (51.6% [31.4-71.6]).	1
459	@DISEASE$ and neutrophil count are frequently predictive in diagnostic models, while comorbidities, sex, @GENE$, and creatinine are frequent prognostic factors.	1
460	The combination of @DISEASE$ and elevated hs-@GENE$ yielded a sensitivity of 67Â·9% and specificity of 78Â·2% (AUC=0Â·730).	1
461	Patients transferred in ICU were more likely to have @DISEASE$, decreased SpO2 and increased D-dimer, @GENE$ and creatinine levels.	1
462	The corresponding AUC of @GENE$ and SAA values for severity of @DISEASE$ were 0.804 and 0.818, respectively.	1
463	Multiple regression analysis indicated that serum T: LH ratio was negatively associated with white blood cell counts and @GENE$ levels in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
464	Few parameters, such Lymphocytes count, SaO2 and @GENE$ serum level can be used to assess the severity of @DISEASE$ in emergency room.	1
465	In this multicenter retrospective cohort study we included adult patients with @DISEASE$, need of respiratory support, and elevated @GENE$ who received intravenous tocilizumab in addition to standard of care.	1
466	All had increased @GENE$ serum level and @DISEASE$.	1
467	Other common clinical features included hypoxia, chest crepitation, @DISEASE$ and high @GENE$.	1
468	Proteins associated with blood coagulation (D-dimer), cell damage (lactate dehydrogenase), and the inflammatory response (e.g., @GENE$) have already been identified as possible predictors of @DISEASE$ severity or mortality.	1
469	Herein, rationale is given for interpretation of @GENE$ blood levels as a simple, rapid, and cost-effective way to assess disease severity and help guide therapeutic options in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
470	@GENE$ values were also measured in patients with newly diagnosed @DISEASE$.	1
471	Laboratory studies showed hemoglobin (Hb) 5.1 g/dL, D-dimer 4.55 Âµg/mL, and @GENE$ 12.3 mg/dL. Computed tomography scan of the chest showed @DISEASE$ involving the bilateral lower lobe segmental branches.	1
472	Age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer and @GENE$ obtained on admission were identified as predictors of mortality for @DISEASE$ patients by LASSO.	1
473	The most common laboratory findings were elevated @GENE$ and @DISEASE$.	1
474	Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (@GENE$, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p &lt; 0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe @DISEASE$, non-White race, and mortality.	1
475	The survival curve analysis showed that higher @GENE$ (â¥5mg/L) plus any other abnormalities of lymphocyte, blood urea nitrogen or lactate dehydrogenase significantly predicted poor prognosis of @DISEASE$ infected elderly patients.	1
476	A total of 268 patients was evaluated; intermediate care units (IMCUs, 61%), sub-intensive care units (SICUs, 8%), intensive care units (ICUs, 17%) and rehabilitation units (RUs, 14%): BMI: &lt;18.5, 9% (higher in RUs, p = 0.008) and â¥30, 13% (higher in ICUs, p = 0.012); WL â¥ 5%, 52% (higher in ICUs and RUs, p = 0.001); @GENE$ &gt;0.5: 78% (higher in ICUs and lower in RUs, p &lt; 0.001); Nutritional risk and @DISEASE$ were present in 77% (higher in ICUs and RUs, p &lt; 0.001) and 50% (higher in ICUs, p = 0.0792) of the patients, respectively.	1
477	Among patients with negative initial chest radiographs, age â¥ 45 years (odds ratio [OR]: 3.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.76-8.75, p = 0.001), absolute lymphocyte count &lt; 1500 cells/Î¼L (OR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.03-4.89, p = 0.041), and @GENE$ &gt; 0.5 mg/dL (OR: 3.91, 95% CI: 1.54-9.91, p = 0.004) were independent predictors for future development of @DISEASE$.	1
478	Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed NLR and @GENE$ were independent risk factors for severe @DISEASE$.	1
479	D-dimer and @GENE$ Blood Levels Over Time Used to Predict Pulmonary Embolism in Two @DISEASE$ Patients.	1
480	And although lymphocyte, D-dimer and @GENE$ levels did not demonstrate diagnostic value, all indicate severity of @DISEASE$.	1
481	Elevated level of @GENE$ may be an early marker to predict risk for severity of @DISEASE$.	1
482	@DISEASE$ related indicators such as WBC#, N#, L#, hs-@GENE$ showed no differences.	1
483	Patients with imaging progression were prone to be advanced in age [years: 60 (46-65) v 47 (37-60.75), P = 0.030]; @DISEASE$ (66.7% v 40.4%, P = 0.042) and low level of @GENE$ [mg/L: 5.7 (1.9-20.2) v 18.9 (6.7-38.9), P = 0.038].	1
484	@GENE$ correlates with computed tomographic findings and predicts severe @DISEASE$ early.	1
485	@GENE$ in severe @DISEASE$ patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.	1
486	Trends observed by serial laboratory measurements during hospitalization including progressive decrease of lymphocyte count, @DISEASE$, elevated @GENE$, procalcitonin, increased liver enzymes, decreased renal function, and coagulation derangements were more common in critically ill patient groups and associated with a high incidence of clinical complications.	1
487	@GENE$, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and ferritin in severe @DISEASE$: a meta-analysis.	1
488	Elevated @GENE$ was associated with an increased composite poor outcome [risk ratio (RR) 1.84 (1.45, 2.33), p &lt; 0.001; I2: 96%] and its severe @DISEASE$ (RR 1.41; I2: 93%) subgroup.	1
489	Subsequently, the @DISEASE$ improved without antipyretics and her @GENE$ level decreased rapidly.	1
490	A @DISEASE$ count and an increased high-sensitivity @GENE$ level were the most common laboratory findings.	1
491	None of them had @DISEASE$ after tocilizumab treatment and the levels of @GENE$ (13.08 Â± 12.89) were almost within normal limits.	1
492	@GENE$ Level May Predict the Risk of @DISEASE$ Aggravation.	1
493	The incidence of progression from severe to @DISEASE$, 28-day mortality, clinical symptom improvement, time to clinical symptom improvement, hematologic indicators including @GENE$, lymphocyte number, and interleukin 6, and imaging changes were observed and compared between the two groups.	1
494	Blood parameters showed @DISEASE$ in 345/418 (83%) of cases and a high @GENE$ in 587/626 (94%).	1
495	Correlation analysis showed that the @DISEASE$ index value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, @GENE$, procalcitonin, days from illness onset, and body temperature (P &lt; 0.05).	1
496	Among the 5 patients, 2 had @DISEASE$ (2/5, 40%), 1 had low absolute neutrophil counts (1/5, 20%), and 2 had increased high-sensitivity @GENE$ (2/5, 40%).	1
497	Many studies have reported the clinical characteristics of @DISEASE$: sudden deterioration of disease around 1-2 weeks after onset; much lower level of lymphocytes, especially natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood; extremely high pro-inflammatory cytokines and @GENE$ (CRP).	1
498	High @GENE$ and D-dimer levels were the parameters most frequently associated with severe @DISEASE$.	1
499	@GENE$ (HR, 1.164 per mg/dL; 95% CI, 1.006-1.347; p = 0.041) was independently associated with CEFS in the mild @DISEASE$ group (n = 54).	1
500	From 1 April 2020, patients with @DISEASE$-associated CSS, defined as rapid respiratory deterioration plus at least two out of three biomarkers with important elevations (@GENE$ &gt;100 mg/L; ferritin &gt;900 Âµg/L; D-dimer &gt;1500 Âµg/L), received high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 5 consecutive days (250 mg on day 1 followed by 80 mg on days 2-5).	1
501	Prognostic value of @GENE$ in patients with @DISEASE$.	1
502	@GENE$ was also an independent discriminator of severe/@DISEASE$ on admission (AUC 0.783, z=10.69, p&lt;0.001).	1
503	Higher biological markers of inflammation (@GENE$: 28 Â± 39 vs. 98 Â± 97 mg/L, p = .04), of fibrinolysis (D-dimer: 804 Â± 1,500 vs. 3,128 Â± 2,458 Î¼g/L, p = .02), and antiphospholipid antibodies in four cases were observed in the @DISEASE$ group.	1
504	Lymphocyte-to-@GENE$ Ratio: A Novel Predictor of Adverse Outcomes in @DISEASE$.	1
505	Patients with TCZ (n=20) had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (5.3 [Â±2.4] vs 3.4 [Â±2.6], P=0.014), presented with more severe forms (higher level of oxygen therapy at 13L/min vs 6L/min, P&lt;0.001), and had poorer biological findings (severe @DISEASE$: 676/mm3 vs 914/mm3, P=0.037 and higher @GENE$ level: 158mg/L vs 105mg/L, P=0.017) than patients without TCZ (n=25).	1
506	In univariate analyses, we also found that patients who died from @DISEASE$ had higher hyperinflammation markers than patients who survived: @GENE$ (181 (IQR 120-220) vs 107.4 (IQR 30-150; p 0.05); lactate dehydrogenase (641.8 (IQR 465.75-853.5) vs 361 (IQR 250-450), p 0.03); serum ferritin (1026 (IQR 228.3-1536.3) vs 861.3 (IQR 389-1490.5), p 0.04); D-dimer (12,019.8 (IQR 843.5-25,790.5) vs 1544.3 (IQR 619-1622), p 0.04).	1
507	@DISEASE$ (median, 0.77 x 103 per mm3; IQR, 0.58-1.00 x 103 per mm3), hyperinflammation with @GENE$ (median, 184.5 mg/dL; IQR, 108.2-269.1 mg/dL) and pro-coagulant status with D-dimer (median, 10.1 Î¼g/m; IQR, 5.0-23.8 Î¼g/m) were present.	1
508	Increased @GENE$ level, @DISEASE$ count, and increased D-dimer level were the most common laboratory findings.	1
509	LDH and @GENE$ may be related to respiratory function (PaO2/FiO2) and be a predictor of @DISEASE$ in CoVID-19 patients.	1
510	We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of @DISEASE$ and @GENE$.	1
511	@DISEASE$ and @GENE$ on arrival may predict poor outcomes.	1
512	The effect of anakinra was rapid, as judged by significant decrease of @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ at day 3.	1
513	@GENE$ is a useful marker to monitor @DISEASE$ in SOT.	1
514	This study revealed that the risk factors for the death in these elderly patients included comorbidities, increased levels of @GENE$ and blood urea nitrogen, and @DISEASE$ during hospitalization.	1
515	The risk factors of neutrophil count, hypersensitivity @GENE$, creatine kinase, and blood urea nitrogen could help clinicians to early identify @DISEASE$ severe patients with poor outcomes on admission.	1
516	Elevated levels of @GENE$ was found in all of them and the majority of them had evidence of @DISEASE$; intensive care admissions were needed in 12 (63%) and vasoactive medications were given to 6 (31.5%) children.	1
517	@GENE$ may help to identify patients with @DISEASE$ who are at greater risk of dying during hospitalization.	1
518	Moreover, the levels of @GENE$ (153.6 (80.3, 240.7) ng/L vs. 49.8 (15.9, 101.9) ng/L) and N-terminal @DISEASE$-type natriuretic peptide (852.0 (400.0, 2 315.3) ng/L vs. 197.0 (115.3, 631.0) ng/L) were significantly higher than patients without myocardial injury (all P&lt;0.01).	1
519	@DISEASE$ and marked elevation of the @GENE$ observed in four (13.3%) and 12 (40%) cases, respectively.	1
520	There were 14 patients (87.5%) with normal or decreased white blood cell count, 11 patients (68.75%) with @DISEASE$ count, 15 patients (93.75%) with increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 13 patients (81.25%) with increased hypersensitivity @GENE$, 5 patients (31.25%) with increased procalcitonin, and 8 patients (50%) with increased serum ferritin in peripheral blood, and stool routine was basically normal.	1
521	The laboratory and radiological characteristics of two groups mainly were @DISEASE$, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased @GENE$, increased lactate dehydrogenase, decreased oxygenation index, normal white blood cell count and bilateral chest CT involvement.	1
522	Early detection of elevations in serum @GENE$, combined with a clinical @DISEASE$ symptom presentation may be used as a surrogate marker for the presence and severity of the disease.	1
523	An increase in D-dimer blood levels and a decrease in @GENE$ blood levels over time may be used as a novel method to predict pulmonary embolism in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
524	Frequent laboratory findings were: elevated @GENE$ and @DISEASE$.	1
525	And although lymphocyte, D-dimer and @GENE$ levels did not demonstrate diagnostic value, all indicate severity of @DISEASE$.	1
526	Normal leukocyte counts (69.7%), @DISEASE$ (56.5%), elevated @GENE$ levels (73.6%), elevated ESR (65.6%), and oxygenation index decreased (63.6%) were observed in most patients.	1
527	Serum @GENE$ levels increase with increasing frequency of FQRS in patients with @DISEASE$ indicating that patients with FQRS are exposed to more inflammation.	1
528	The leukocyte, lymphocyte, and thrombocyte count and @GENE$ levels were lowest in the @DISEASE$ group (p&lt;0.001, p=0.04, p&lt;0.001, p=0.007 respectively).	1
529	In addition, @DISEASE$ patients showed higher mean platelet volume, lower @GENE$ concentrations, and higher De Ritis ratio.	1
530	The improvement of LYM and @GENE$ may be associated with the prognoses of @DISEASE$.	1
531	The two cases with severe illness had profound @DISEASE$ with markedly elevated @GENE$, procalcitonin, and ferritin.	1
532	Therefore, it is imperative to closely monitor laboratory parameters including the WBC count, LYMPH count, and @GENE$, along with other imaging features in chest CT scans, to promptly prevent, diagnose, and treat a @DISEASE$ during pregnancy.	1
533	Patients with @DISEASE$ had higher peak inflammatory markers like @GENE$ 184 (111-258) versus 142 (65-229) p = 0.012 and peak LDH 560 (384-758) versus 499 (324-655) p = 0.017.	1
534	Patients exhibited @DISEASE$ and elevated inflammatory markers, including @GENE$ and ferritin.	1
535	The @GENE$, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of @DISEASE$ assessed on initial CT (Rrange, 0.36-0.75; P &lt; 0.05).	1
536	This meta-analysis showed that an elevated serum @GENE$, PCT, D-dimer, and ferritin were associated with a poor outcome in @DISEASE$.	1
537	The CXR score showed a significant positive correlation with @GENE$, lactate dehydrogenase, and @DISEASE$ duration, and a negative correlation with oxygen saturation.	1
538	Signature score differences in laboratory and CT imaging features between subgroups were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05); @DISEASE$ was negatively correlated with GLCM Entropy_angle 90_offset4 (r=-0.578), but was positively correlated with ShortRunEmphhasis_AllDirect_offset4_SD (r=0.454); @GENE$ was positively correlated with Cluster Prominence_ AllDirect_offset 4_ SD (r=0.47).	1
539	The proportion of ground glass opacity (GGO), @DISEASE$ and the total lesion based on the quantitative method was positively correlated with the semi-quantitative CT score (P &lt; 0.001 for all; rs = 0.88, 0.87, 0.90), @GENE$ (P = 0.0278, 0.0168, 0.0078; rs = 0.40, 0.43, 0.48) and ESR (P = 0.0296, 0.0408, 0.0048; rs = 0.46, 0.44, 0.58), respectively, and was negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count (P = 0.0222, 0.0024, 0.0068; rs = -0.42, -0.53, -0.48).	1
540	Our results demonstrated that the nomogram and Combined Index calculated from the NLR and @GENE$ are potential and reliable predictors of @DISEASE$ prognosis and can triage patients at the time of admission.	1
541	In addition, they were more likely to have increased inflammatory response and @DISEASE$ as reflected in @GENE$ (51.1 (1.3-127.9) vs 12.1 (0.1-212.0) mg/L, p&lt;0.05) and D-dimer (6.9 (0.3-20.0) vs 0.5 (0.1-20.0) mg/L, p&lt;0.001).	1
542	Admission to the PICU was significantly associated with higher @GENE$, procalcitonin, and @DISEASE$ type natriuretic peptide levels and platelet counts (P &lt; .05 for all).	1
543	Owing to 44-60% @DISEASE$ presentation, risk of the high inflammatory state, and coagulation cascade abnormalities reported in ECoVs, testing for @GENE$, serum creatine kinase, and D-dimer level is mandatory.	1
544	The @DISEASE$ (0.37 Ã 109/L [interquartile range: 0.23-0.65]) and increased @GENE$ (24.7 Ã 109/L [interquartile range: 13.57-38]) were observed.	1
545	In this multicenter retrospective study, routine laboratory parameters (@GENE$, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts), demographic data and the chest X-ray/CT result from 967 patients entering the ED with @DISEASE$ were collected.	1
546	Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) peak values were correlated with risk of death (OR 1.007 [95% CI 1.002-1.01], P = 0.005) along with age, multiple comorbidities, @DISEASE$ , ICU admission and @GENE$.	1
547	Common laboratory features included @DISEASE$ [6/7 (86%)], elevated lactate dehydrogenase [3/4 (75%)], D-dimer [5/6 (83%)], high-sensitivity @GENE$ [4/4 (100%)] and procalcitonin [5/5 (100%)].	1
548	Seventeen factors were independently associated with an increased hazard of death, the strongest among them included advanced age, @DISEASE$, low age-adjusted oxygen saturation, higher concentrations of @GENE$, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate.	1
549	@DISEASE$ women had a higher BMI (p &lt; 0.001), systolic (p &lt; 0.0001) and diastolic (p &lt; 0.05) blood pressure, waist circumference (p &lt; 0.0001), testosterone (p &lt; 0.0001), free androgen index (p &lt; 0.0001) and @GENE$ (p &lt; 0.0001).	1
550	@DISEASE$ (59%) with elevated @GENE$ (70%) was observed and 91% of the women were delivered by cesarean section.	1
551	On multivariable analysis, age (per-year increase OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.10; p &lt; 0.001), @DISEASE$ (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.07-6.25; p 0.03), and @GENE$ levels (per-point increase OR 1.009; 95% CI 1.004-1.014; p 0.001) were independent risk factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality.	1
552	Marked elevation of cytokines/chemokines is observed with elevation of additional markers of inflammation, coagulation, and organ damage such as @GENE$, D-dimer, LDH, Ferritin and Troponin-I. This hyperinflammation leads to worsening of oxygen saturation due to pulmonary infiltration and exudation, organ damage, and dysfunction of coagulation pathway and may lead to multi-@DISEASE$.	1
553	Before regular treatments, the sum score of the opacities showed @DISEASE$ to moderate correlations with duration, @GENE$, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase levels (R ranged from 0.341-0.651, P &lt; .05).	1
554	Several laboratory markers (lower O2 saturation and platelets, and higher leukocytes, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, @GENE$, procalcitonin, and ferritin) were associated with @DISEASE$ severity.	1
555	Higher levels of @DISEASE$ indices (e.g. white blood cell count, neutrophil count, @GENE$ and procalcitonin) were observed in the elevated group.	1
556	There was a significant positive correlation between Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QTc ratio and @GENE$ in patients with newly diagnosed @DISEASE$ (rs = 0.332, p = .005, rs = 0.397, p &lt; .001 consecutively).	1
557	CONCLUSIONS Old age (&gt;70 years old), @GENE$ &gt;100 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase &gt;300 U/L, and lactic acid &gt;3 mmol/L are high-risk factors related to myocardial damage in critical patients with @DISEASE$.	1
558	Compared with the first hospitalization, there were significant decreases in @DISEASE$ (5 vs 0, P = .035), elevated levels of both white blood cell count (P = .036) and lymphocyte count (P = .002), remarkedly decreases in @GENE$ and serum amyloid A (P &lt; .05) in the second hospitalization.	1
559	Higher levels of NLR and @GENE$ at admission were associated with poor prognosis of individuals with moderate @DISEASE$.	1
560	ROC curve analysis revealed that the AUC of age, @GENE$ and lymphocyte count for @DISEASE$ were 0.873, 0.911 and 0.817, respectively.	1
561	Laboratory findings are nonspecific; @DISEASE$, elevation of @GENE$ and procalcitonin have been described.	1
562	We suggest that higher, possibly therapeutic levels of anticoagulation might be mandatory for a further subset of patients with @DISEASE$ where a discrepant evolution of @GENE$ and D-dimer is observed.	1
563	A meta-analysis of seven studies with 1905 patients showed that increased @GENE$ (OR 3.0, 95% CI: 2.1-4.4), @DISEASE$ (OR 4.5, 95% CI: 3.3-6.0), and increased LDH (OR 6.7, 95% CI: 2.4-18.9) were significantly associated with severity.	1
564	The assessment of serum biochemical and blood hematological factors showed that there was a strong correlation between @DISEASE$ intensity and high serum Cr, BUN, and ALT levels, high @GENE$ concentration, and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts in male KTRs.	1
565	Data were collected on age, sex, physical ability, rehabilitation modality (remote/direct), need for intubation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, degree of @DISEASE$, oxygen therapy from the start of rehabilitation, D-dimer and @GENE$ levels, and rehabilitation-related complications.	1
566	The elderly and patients with higher level of @GENE$ were more likely to experience a severe outcome of @DISEASE$.	1
567	@GENE$ levels in the early stage of @DISEASE$.	1
568	Among all univariable parameters, lymphocytes, @GENE$, and LDH were significantly independent risk factors of @DISEASE$ severity.	1
569	To investigate the value of the combined detection of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and @GENE$ level (CRP) in the diagnosis of @DISEASE$.	1
570	Importantly, @GENE$, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe @DISEASE$.	1
571	Laboratory findings included elevated @GENE$ (57%) and @DISEASE$ (50%).	1
572	Visceral fat (VAT) was significantly higher in patients requiring intensive care (p = 0.032), together with age (p = 0.009), inflammation markers @GENE$ and LDH (p &lt; 0.0001, p = 0.003, respectively), and @DISEASE$ severity as assessed by a Lung Severity Score (LSS) (p &lt; 0.0001).	1
573	Patients without @DISEASE$ still exhibited mild illness and had elevated SAA levels but not @GENE$ levels.	1
574	For patients with elevated levels of both SAA and @GENE$, and a high NLR, a @DISEASE$ was predicted, requiring medical attention.	1
575	Therefore, @GENE$ and SAA levels demonstrate a prognostic value for predicting the severity of @DISEASE$.	1
576	Most of the liver function indexes in @DISEASE$ patients were correlated with @GENE$ and NLR, the markers of inflammation.	1
577	1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), @GENE$ level &gt;200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level &gt;2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with @DISEASE$ than age or comorbidities.	1
578	The following parameters were comparable including lymphocyte counts, @GENE$, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, bilateral involvement in chest CT (76.9% vs. 71.9%), worsening of @DISEASE$ (15.4% vs. 9.4%), favorable outcome (92.3% vs. 96.9%) between ACEI/ARB group and non-ACEI/ARB group respectively (all P&gt;0.05).	1
579	During the prenatal and postpartum period, there was no difference in the count of WBC, Neutrophils and Lymphocyte, the radio of Neutrophils and Lymphocyte and the level of @GENE$ between the confirmed @DISEASE$ group and the control group(p&lt;0.05).	1
580	@GENE$ and D-dimer levels positively correlated with severe @DISEASE$ and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio decreased as the patients improved clinically.	1
581	Moreover, the smooth curve fitting graph reflected that the severity of @DISEASE$ was positively correlated with both age and @GENE$ levels (all P value &lt; 0.05).	1
582	@DISEASE$ were positively related to @GENE$ levels but negatively related to sleep quality.	1
583	In the multivariate regression, @DISEASE$ (odds ratio [OR], 8.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.81-44.42; P = 0.007), CT score &gt; 5 (OR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.44-9.53; P = 0.007), old age (&gt; 77 years, OR, 9.96; 95% CI, 3.78-26.28; P &lt; 0.001), and elevated @GENE$ (OR, 4.15; 95% CI, 1.62-10.6; P = 0.003) were significant prognostic factors of severe disease.	1
584	The prognostic value of admission @GENE$ was evaluated in patients with @DISEASE$.	1
585	Receiver operating characteristic analysis concluded LDH (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.875), D-dimer (AUC: 0.803), and PCT (AUC: 0.769) were superior biomarkers to ferritin (AUC: 0.714) and @GENE$ (AUC: 0.711) in predicting the fatality of @DISEASE$.	1
586	Logistic regression indicated that SAA and @GENE$ were independent risk factors for the severity of @DISEASE$.	1
587	24 patients (18 symptomatic, 6 asymptomatic) with confirmed @DISEASE$ by polymerase chain reaction underwent bedside ChUS in addition to @GENE$ following admission.	1
588	We aimed to investigate patterns of ChUS in @DISEASE$ patients and compare the findings with results from chest X-ray (@GENE$).	1
589	@DISEASE$ virus was prepared by propagating the virus in Vero @GENE$-81 cells.	1

591	Transcriptome &amp; viral growth analysis of @DISEASE$-infected Vero @GENE$-81 cells.	1
592	In addition, preference was given to @GENE$ donors who had a @DISEASE$ lasting more than 3 days or a body temperature exceeding 38.5Â°C (101.3Â°F), and who donated 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms.	1
593	In this scope competent authorities are responsible to set up certain principles and criteria for the collection and clinical use of @DISEASE$ Convalescent Plasma (@GENE$).	1
594	In addition, all of the @GENE$ donors' plasma units were negative for @DISEASE$ RNA.	1

596	In addition to routine donor testing, the @GENE$ donors' plasma was also tested for @DISEASE$ nucleic acid and S-RBD-specific IgG antibody.	1
597	The @GENE$ RT-PCR @DISEASE$ was positive in one patient.	1
598	Recombinant @GENE$ administered by direct inhalation is currently being studied in a cohort of patients with advanced @DISEASE$.	1
599	Patients were excluded from the trial in case of (1) known serious allergic reactions to yeast-derived products, (2) lithium carbonate therapy, (3) mechanical ventilation prior to randomization, (4) peripheral white blood cell count above 25.000/Î¼L and/or active @DISEASE$, (5) high dose systemic steroid therapy (&gt; 20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent), (6) enrolment in another investigational study, (7) pregnant or breastfeeding or (8) ferritin levels &gt; 2000 Î¼g/mL. Inhaled @GENE$ 125 Î¼g twice daily for 5 days in addition to standard care.	1
600	@DISEASE$ has been detected in the @GENE$ of some patients.	1
601	None of the patients had MRI features of @DISEASE$ nor significant @GENE$ abnormalities.	1
602	The specific @DISEASE$ RNA was not detected in the nasopharyngeal swab but was detected in a @GENE$.	1
603	MRI of the brain demonstrated acute multifocal demyelinating lesions, and @GENE$ testing did not identify a direct cerebral @DISEASE$.	1
604	Subjects progressing to @DISEASE$ and requiring invasive mechanical ventilatory support, from day 6 onwards in the standard of care group will have the option (clinician's decision) to initiate IV @GENE$ 125m Î¼g/m2 body surface area once daily for 5 days.	1
605	As far as we know from this reported case and the review of the current literature, there seems to be no association with antiganglioside antibodies or a positive @DISEASE$ RT-PCR in @GENE$.	1
606	@GENE$-based treatments in @DISEASE$: reconciling opposing therapeutic approaches.	1
607	Both administration and inhibition of @GENE$ are currently being therapeutically tested in @DISEASE$ clinical trials.	1

612	Anti-@GENE$ monoclonal antibodies, TJ003234 and gimsilumab, will be tested in clinical trials in patients with @DISEASE$, while lenzilumab received FDA approval for compassionate use.	1
613	@GENE$ could link T-cell-driven acute @DISEASE$ with an autocrine, self-amplifying cytokine loop leading to monocyte and macrophage activation.	1

616	Although monocytes and protein levels in @GENE$ were only marginally increased, and our patient never experienced a hyperinflammatory state, her neurologic function deteriorated into @DISEASE$.	1
617	@GENE$ testing was negative for @DISEASE$.	1
618	In addition, @DISEASE$ was not detected in the @GENE$ collected from the 2 patients who underwent lumbar puncture.	1
619	Oropharyngeal swab test for @DISEASE$ by qualitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay was positive in both patients and negative in the @GENE$.	1
620	@DISEASE$ RT-PCR in the @GENE$ was negative for all patients.	1
621	Telemedicine was broadly utilized; there was high consensus to interrupt chemotherapy in COVID-positive patients (I=75%, C=55% and E=83.3%) and for @GENE$ primary prophylaxis use for @DISEASE$ (I=65%, C=62.9% and E=50%).	1

631	The 3-@GENE$ protease (3CLpro), an essential enzyme for viral replication, is a valid target to combat @DISEASE$ and MERS-CoV. In this work, we present a structure-based study to identify potential covalent inhibitors containing a variety of chemical warheads.	1
632	This study investigates the inhibitory effect of the 3-@GENE$ protease of @DISEASE$ (3CLpro) using pharmaceuticals containing Î±-ketoamide group and pyridone ring based on molecular docking.	1
633	In addition, natural products were shown to inhibit the @DISEASE$ life-cycle related proteins such as papain-like or @GENE$ proteases.	1
634	One-hundred and eighteen candidate constituents showed a high binding affinity with @DISEASE$-2 3-@GENE$ protease (3CLpro), as indicated by molecular docking using computational pattern recognition.	1
635	The conserved 3-@GENE$ protease (3CLpro), which controls coronavirus replication is a promising drug target for combating the @DISEASE$.	1
636	@DISEASE$ enters the cells through endocytosis process, which is possibly facilitated, via a pH dependent endosomal @GENE$ cathepsins.	1
637	We found that <span class='variant' id='p SUB E 64 D__ProteinMutation-6-14-18'>E64D</span> (inhibitor of endosomal proteases @GENE$ and L) and apilimod (endosomal trafficking inhibitor) potently decreased the amount of @DISEASE$ RNA in cell culture supernatants with minimal cytotoxicity.	1

645	We analyzed positive @DISEASE$ testing results counts within New York City @GENE$ Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) with Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations.	1
646	@DISEASE$ were highly variable by @GENE$ code and differed by race/ethnicity.	1
647	Blacks/African American Communities are at Highest Risk of @DISEASE$: Spatial Modeling of New York City @GENE$ Code-Level Testing Results.	1
648	In both cities, cold spots (clusters of low @DISEASE$ rate @GENE$ code tabulation areas as identified by the Getis-Ord (GI*) statistic) demonstrated social determinants of health characteristics typically associated with better health outcomes and the ability to maintain physical distance (  social distancing  ).	1
649	Hot spots (clusters of high @DISEASE$ rate @GENE$ code tabulation areas) had similarities as well, such as lower rates of college graduates and higher proportions of people of color.	1
650	An ecological study was performed to determine the spatial distribution of @DISEASE$ testing by @GENE$ code Tabulation Area and investigate if testing was associated with race or SES.	1
651	Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed MADE-@GENE$ model outperforms the competitive @DISEASE$ classification approaches in terms of various performance metrics.	1
652	Therefore, the proposed MADE-@GENE$ model can be used in real-time @DISEASE$ classification systems.	1
653	@GENE$19 is a mobile decision support system designed and developed to assist GPs in providing dynamic risk assessments for patients with suspected @DISEASE$ during the outbreak, and the model had a good ability to predict risk levels in any scenario it covered.	1

655	Current clinical evidence does not support stopping @GENE$ inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with @DISEASE$.	1
656	@GENE$ inhibitors do not increase the risk of poor outcomes in @DISEASE$ disease.	1
657	@GENE$ inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker in @DISEASE$: Safe and possibly beneficial.	1
658	A great interest is currently directed towards the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (@GENE$ 2) which is the @DISEASE$ receptor and creates important connections between the virus replication pathway, the cardiovascular system and blood pressure.	1
659	However, for those already taking these medications, both the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology recommend continuing the treatment, because at present, there is no clear clinical or scientific evidence to justify the discontinuation of @GENE$-I or @DISEASE$.	1
660	As two-thirds of hypertensive patients take @GENE$ inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, several concerns have been raised about the detrimental role of current antihypertensive drugs in @DISEASE$.	1
661	An unprotected person exposed to this cloud, might inhale a considerable amount of infectious viral doses, which will attach to the @GENE$ 2 receptors on alveoli epithelium, resulting in @DISEASE$.	1

663	Worldwide @GENE$ (I/D) polymorphism may affect @DISEASE$ recovery rate: an ecological meta-regression.	1
664	In this regard, we conducted a meta-analysis study of the prevalence of @GENE$ (I/D) genotype in countries most affected by the @DISEASE$.	1
665	Given the importance of the @GENE$ 2/Ang-(1-7) pathway and the potential differences between adults and children, it is crucial that children are included in coronavirus-related research, as this may shed light on potential mechanisms for why children are at decreased risk of severe @DISEASE$.	1
666	Could @GENE$ 1 I/D polymorphism be a modificator of @DISEASE$ response in different populations, diseases, and/or conditions?	1
667	Many high-risk @DISEASE$ patients with comorbidities are on @GENE$ inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, and this has sparked debate about whether to continue these treatment regimes.	1

686	More evidence is urgently needed to confirm the relation between @GENE$ inhibitors and @DISEASE$.	1
687	In total, 113 hypertensive Covid-19 patients were included, of them 74 patients were using @GENE$ inh/@DISEASE$.	1

689	Older @DISEASE$-affected patients with cardiovascular comorbidities exhibit a more severe clinical course and a worse prognosis, with many of them being also treated with ARBs or @GENE$-Is.	1
690	Despite the relevance of experimental animal studies, to comprehensively address the question of the potential hazards or benefits of @GENE$-Is and ARBs on the clinical course of @DISEASE$-affected patients treated by these anti-hypertensive drugs, we will need randomized human studies.	1
691	It has been hypothesised that the use of @GENE$ inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) might either increase or reduce the risk of severe or lethal @DISEASE$.	1

694	All patients showed clinical features typical of @DISEASE$ and positive chest CT scan, and were treated with @GENE$-Is as needed.	1
695	However, there was no evidence that @GENE$ inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of @DISEASE$.	1
696	In the light of the above considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the suggestion to discontinue @GENE$-inhibitors or ARBs in all patients with the aim of preventing or limiting the diffusion of @DISEASE$ virus is not based on clinical evidence.	1

763	It is likely that @GENE$ inh/@DISEASE$ therapy might not be beneficial in the subgroup of hypertensive Covid-19 patients despite the fact that there might be the possibility of some unmeasured residual confounders to affect the results of the study.	1
764	Concurrent therapy with an @GENE$-I was associated with an increased rate and severity of @DISEASE$ with the HCoV-NL63.	1
765	Since @GENE$-Is and ARBs have different molecular targets, the clinical course of @DISEASE$ could be also different in patients treated by one or the other of these two drug classes.	1
766	In this study, vitamin D, @GENE$ concentrations, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were measured in patients with confirmed @DISEASE$ in comparison with control group.	1

862	While it may not be measuring @DISEASE$, its components suggest that increases in @GENE$-4 may be reflecting systemic inflammation associated with poor outcomes.	1
863	In middle-aged patients with @DISEASE$, @GENE$-4 may have a prognostic role.	1
864	The @GENE$-4 Index Is Associated with Need for Mechanical Ventilation and 30-day Mortality in Patients Admitted with @DISEASE$.	1
865	In this multicenter, retrospective study with prospective follow-up of 160 patients aged 35-65 years with @DISEASE$, @GENE$-4, clinical, and biochemical variables were collected at baseline.	1
866	Selective @GENE$ Modulators in @DISEASE$: A Possible Therapeutic Option?	1
867	Among patients receiving neoadjuvant endocrine therapy or no medical therapy, higher scores were assigned for low-@GENE$ or high-genomic risk scores, higher grade, larger @DISEASE$, younger age and longer delay.	1
868	Here, we combine homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding affinity calculations to determine potential targets for toremifene, a selective @GENE$ modulator which we have previously identified as a @DISEASE$ inhibitor.	1
869	Our analysis excluded most previously identified drugs but identified members of 4 drug classes (antimalarial amino-quinolones, selective @GENE$ modulators; SERMs, low potency tricyclic antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants) as potential drug candidates for @DISEASE$.	1
870	Rapid blood tests, including platelet count, @GENE$ time, D-dimer, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio can help clinicians to assess severity and prognosis of patients with @DISEASE$.	1
871	The D-dimer is frequently elevated in @DISEASE$, but other markers of coagulation activation, including the @GENE$ fragment 1.2 (PF1.2) are poorly described.	1
872	In patients with elevated @GENE$ time, @DISEASE$/anti-cardiolipin antibody-positivity should be suspected, and anticoagulation prophylaxis should be continued perioperatively for better outcomes.	1
873	Multivariate logistic regression showed that an age over 60 years (OR=8.165, 95% CI: 1.483-45.576, P=0.017), prolonged @GENE$ time (OR=7.516, 95% CI: 2.568-21.998, P=0.006) and elevated NT-proBNP (OR=6.194, 95% CI: 1.305-29.404, P=0.022) were independent risk factors for critical type of @DISEASE$.	1
874	Compared with healthy controls, @GENE$ time activity (PT-act) was lower in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
875	In multivariate analyses, death was associated with increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (â¥9Â·13; odds ratio [OR] 5Â·39 [95% CI 1Â·70-17Â·13], p=0Â·0042), @DISEASE$ (platelet count &lt;100 Ã 109 per L; OR 8Â·33 [2Â·56-27Â·15], p=0Â·00045), prolonged @GENE$ time (&gt;16 s; OR 4Â·94 [1Â·50-16Â·25], p=0Â·0094), and increased D-dimer (&gt;2 mg/L; OR 4Â·41 [1Â·06-18Â·30], p=0Â·041).	1
876	Liver anomalies were predominantly mild to moderately elevated transaminases, @DISEASE$ and prolongation of @GENE$ time.	1
877	@DISEASE$ (lymphocyte count, 0.8 Ã 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged @GENE$ time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%).	1
878	A total of 118 patients (49 males and 69 females) were included in this study; the results revealed that the following factors associated with in-hospital mortality: older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.175, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.073-1.287, P = .001), neutrophil count greater than 6.3 Ã 10 cells/L (OR 7.174, (95% CI 2.295-22.432, P = .001), @DISEASE$ (OR 0.069, 95% CI 0.007-0.722, P = .026), @GENE$ time &gt;13 seconds (OR 11.869, 95% CI 1.433-98.278, P = .022), D-dimer &gt;1 mg/L (OR 22.811, 95% CI 2.224-233.910, P = .008) and procalcitonin (PCT) &gt;0.1 ng/mL (OR 23.022, 95% CI 3.108-170.532, P = .002).	1
879	An age over 60 years, a prolonged @GENE$ time and elevated NT-proBNP level are important clinical features of critically ill patients with @DISEASE$, and can be deemed as early warning signals for critical conditions of the disease.	1
880	D-Dimer and @GENE$ Time Are the Significant Indicators of Severe @DISEASE$ and Poor Prognosis.	1
881	Neither infant was infected with @DISEASE$, but both had increased @GENE$ time and fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphocreatine kinase, and creatine kinase isoenzyme contents.	1
882	In multivariable analysis, intubation (p&lt;0.001) and prolonged @GENE$ time (p=0.04) showed a significant association with undergoing imaging; no patient variable was significantly associated with imaging positive for @DISEASE$ (p&gt;0.05).	1
883	Activation of the @GENE$, mediators and hormones impact on the hemostasis, endothelial activation, alveolar epithelial cells and mucosal inflammatory responses which are the essentials of the @DISEASE$ pathophysiology.	1
884	@GENE$: A target for repurposing in the treatment of @DISEASE$?	1
885	@GENE$ activation also impacts on the actions of other cell types involved in @DISEASE$ pathobiology, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts and pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells.	1
886	@GENE$ may be a critical mediator associated with the development of thrombotic phenomena in @DISEASE$, and should be a target for future study.	1
887	Platelet activation and platelet-monocyte aggregates formation trigger @GENE$ expression in severe @DISEASE$ patients.	1
888	@DISEASE$ replicates in TF-bearing epithelial and endothelial cells and may stimulate and integrate host cell @GENE$, like HSV1 and other known coagulopathic viruses.	1
889	Additionally, the generation of antiphospholipid antibodies associated with @DISEASE$ may also promote an increase in @GENE$.	1
890	Meanwhile, the patients displayed dramatically elevated levels of serum inflammatory factors, while a markedly prolonged activated partial @GENE$ time (APTT) in critically ill patients reflected @DISEASE$.	1
891	@GENE$ also functions from within the nascent TF/FVIIa/FXa complex to trigger profound changes via protease-activated receptors (PARs) in many cell types, including @DISEASE$-trophic cells.	1
892	Therefore, aberrant expression of @GENE$ may be the underlying basis of @DISEASE$ symptoms.	1
893	Strikingly, envelope @GENE$ is essential for HSV1 @DISEASE$ in mice, and the FXa-directed oral anticoagulant apixaban had remarkable antiviral efficacy.	1
894	Bowles et al. have found that @DISEASE$ were positive in 91% of patients (n=34) with high activated partial @GENE$ time (aPTT).	1
895	The @DISEASE$ group was different from the non-VTE group in age, lymphocyte counts, activated partial @GENE$ time (APTT), D-dimer, etc.	1
896	In support of the hypothesis that the complement system along with neutrophils and platelets contributes to @DISEASE$, the authors presented empirical evidence showing that treatment with the complement inhibitor, compstatin Cp-40, inhibited the expression of @GENE$ in neutrophils.	1
897	Complement and @GENE$-enriched neutrophil extracellular traps are key drivers in @DISEASE$ immunothrombosis.	1
898	The data on @GENE$ discussed in this paper, although preliminary and limited in number, seem to suggest that the thrombogenicity of @DISEASE$ might be linked to widespread endothelial damage.	1
899	Preliminary Post-Mortem @DISEASE$ Evidence of Endothelial Injury and @GENE$ Hyperexpression.	1
900	Complications included @DISEASE$ (25.8%), @GENE$ (22.6%), and septic shock (16.1%), etc.	1
901	Potential Therapeutic Roles for Direct @GENE$ Inhibitors in @DISEASE$.	1
902	For health care providers, some barriers to reporting may include fear of negative feedback, @DISEASE$, legal concerns, and uncertainty about whether an incident qualifies as an @GENE$.	1
903	Therefore, we propose that topical rh-@GENE$ is an effective therapeutic agent for facemask wearing-induced @DISEASE$ and worth of popularizing and applying.	1
904	Topical recombinant human @GENE$: An effective therapeutic agent for facemask wearing-induced @DISEASE$.	1
905	The results from a small sample size survey conducted in Zhongfaxincheng campuses of Tongji Hospital showed that treatment with topical rh-@GENE$ could significantly inhibit the progression of @DISEASE$ and accelerate the wound healing with no apparent ill-effects.	1
906	@GENE$: a novel biomarker for detection of @DISEASE$ progression.	1
907	a total of 46,014 @DISEASE$ cases were reported from 19 countries in the @GENE$ countries who were paralyzed from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019.	1
908	we observed an overall increase in the sensitivity of the @DISEASE$ surveillance performance for the @GENE$ sub-region countries from 2012 to 2019 using the national performance indicators.	1
909	Recent data released by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and @GENE$ (European Space Agency) indicates that pollution in some of the epicenters of @DISEASE$ such as Wuhan, Italy, Spain and USA etc.	1
910	These agents included tenofovir (TFV), 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA), alovudine (@GENE$), lamivudine (3TC), and emtricitabine (@DISEASE$), known as nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and a number of 5'-O-fatty acylated anti-HIV nucleoside conjugates.	1
911	The Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and @DISEASE$ Checklist-Civilian Version (@GENE$-C) were used to assess mental status.	1
912	The @DISEASE$ Checklist-Civilian (@GENE$-C) questionnaire and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) were used for evaluation.	1
913	A total of 584 youth enrolled in this study and completed the question about cognitive status of @DISEASE$, the General Health Questionnaire(GHQ-12), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (@GENE$-C) and the Negative coping styles scale.	1
914	Inhaled biguanides and @GENE$ inhibition for @DISEASE$ and coronavirus (Review).	1
915	Is It Rational to Inhibit the @GENE$-Dependent Pathway as @DISEASE$ Therapy?	1
916	A standard strategy of @DISEASE$ minimization was applied: discontinue the antimetabolite drug and reduce trough levels of calcineurin or @GENE$ inhibitors.	1
917	Recent work has shown that @GENE$ pathways in conjunction with AMPK may offer valuable targets to control cell injury, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the onset of hyperinflammation, a significant disability associated with @DISEASE$.	1

919	@GENE$ inhibition and p53 activation, microRNAs: The possible therapy against pandemic @DISEASE$.	1
920	At @DISEASE$ diagnosis, @GENE$ inhibitors or mycophenolate were withdrawn.	1
921	In the case of gastrointestinal or respiratory signs with @DISEASE$, the discontinuation of mycophenolate or @GENE$ inhibitors is recommended with decrease of the trough levels of calcineurin inhibitors to the lowest effective limit.	1
922	Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) may be continued or substituted for @GENE$ inhibitors with lowest therapeutic concentrations in moderate to severe @DISEASE$.	1

930	He was found to have hemoglobin D @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ deficiency during further evaluation.	1
931	With worldwide spread of @DISEASE$, especially in regions with a high prevalence of @GENE$ deficiency, our case should alert physicians to this possible correlation.	1
932	NAC was also administered to 9 additional respirator-dependent @DISEASE$-infected patients without @GENE$ deficiency.	1
933	CONCLUSIONS Hydroxychloroquine therapy can induce hemolytic crises in patients with underlying @GENE$ deficiency or @DISEASE$ and should be avoided or closely monitored.	1
934	Hydroxychloroquine is suspected to trigger haemolytic crisis in @GENE$-deficient patients, and off-label administration of this drug to patients infected with the novel coronavirus (@DISEASE$) could cause concern.	1
935	@DISEASE$ also exhibited similar associations with PHQ-2 and @GENE$.	1
936	PHQ-2 and @GENE$ scores were not associated with severities of any other symptoms during the @DISEASE$ course.	1
937	Depressive and @DISEASE$ were assessed with the PHQ-9 and @GENE$ scales, respectively.	1

944	The common medications used to treat people with @DISEASE$, such as @GENE$ analogues, statins, and antiplatelets agents, should be continued because these agents have anti-inflammatory properties and play protective roles against cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.	1
945	The aim of this randomised @GENE$-controlled trial is to clarify whether combination therapy with the antibiotic azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine via anti-inflammation/immune modulation, antiviral efficacy and pre-emptive treatment of supra-infections can shorten hospitalisation duration for patients with @DISEASE$ (measured as   days alive and out of hospital   as the primary outcome), reduce the risk of non- invasive ventilation, treatment in the intensive care unit and death.	1
946	However, circulating levels of the cholangiocyte injury biomarker Î³-glutamyltransferase (@GENE$) have yet to be reported in the existing @DISEASE$ case studies.	1
947	Herein, we describe the relationship between @GENE$ levels and clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with @DISEASE$.	1
948	@GENE$ therapy at the time of @DISEASE$: adherence and drug supply issues.	1
949	Patients with @DISEASE$ and/or cerebral microbleeds had neuroimaging performed later during the hospitalization course (27 versus 10.6 days; P&lt;0.001), were clinically sicker at the time of brain MRI (median @GENE$ 6 versus 14; P&lt;0.001), and had higher peak D-dimer levels (8018Â±6677 versus 3183Â±3482; P&lt;0.001), lower nadir platelet count (116.9Â±62.2 versus 158.3Â±76.2; P=0.03), higher peak international normalized ratio (2.2 versus 1.57; P&lt;0.001) values when compared with patients who had a brain MRI that did not show these findings.	1

955	The aim of this randomised @GENE$-controlled trial is to clarify whether combination therapy with the antibiotic azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine via anti-inflammation/immune modulation, antiviral efficacy and pre-emptive treatment of supra-infections can shorten hospitalisation duration for patients with @DISEASE$ (measured as   days alive and out of hospital   as the primary outcome), reduce the risk of non- invasive ventilation, treatment in the intensive care unit and death.	1
956	We aim to assess if elevations in @GENE$/ALT were associated with poor outcomes in hospitalized @DISEASE$ patients.	1
957	An updated meta-analysis of @GENE$ and ALT levels and the mortality of @DISEASE$ patients.	1
958	The changes in peripheral blood cells were mainly lymphonpenia (83 cases, 55%) and @DISEASE$ (95 cases, 63%), The lymphocyte count of the severe and critically ill patients was more significantly reduced, and some patients had increased myocardial enzymes, mainly LDH (47 cases, 31%), and a few patients had liver function damage, mainly manifested in ALT and @GENE$.	1
959	Conclusion: @GENE$-dominant aminotransferase elevation is common in @DISEASE$, mirrors disease severity, and appears to reflect true hepatic injury.	1
960	Age [ OR 5.73 (95% CI, 1.14-28.81)], @DISEASE$ [OR 5.50 (95%CI, 1.02-29.64)], @GENE$ [OR 6.57 (95%CI, 1.33-32.48)]and BUN [5.59 (95%CI, 1.05-29.74)] at admission were considered to predict the risk of death in critical patients and were selected to construct the nomogram.	1
961	Rising bilirubin and @GENE$/ALT ratio predicted mortality among @DISEASE$ patients.	1
962	Serum ALT (WMD: 7.19 [4.90, 9.48]; p &lt; 0.001; I2 = 69%), @GENE$ (WMD: 9.02 [6.89, 11.15]; p &lt; 0.001; I2 = 73%) and bilirubin levels (WMD: 1.78 [0.86, 2.70]; p &lt; 0.001; I2 = 82%) were significantly higher in patients with severe @DISEASE$ when compared to patients with non-severe disease.	1
963	The levels of ALT, @GENE$, TBIL, LDH and INR showed statistically significant elevation in severe @DISEASE$ cases compared with that in mild cases.	1
964	ALT/@GENE$ elevation was common and independently associated with adverse clinical outcomes in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
965	Correlation between Heart @GENE$ and severe @DISEASE$: A case-control study.	1
966	Class A @GENE$ Antagonist Famotidine as a Therapeutic Alternative Against @DISEASE$:	1
967	Famotidine, a class A @GENE$ antagonist used for the treatment of @DISEASE$ was recently identified in an in silico screening.	1
968	AST highly correlated with @GENE$ throughout the illness course (r = 0.97; P &lt; 0.0001), whereas correlations with markers of muscle injury and inflammation were @DISEASE$.	1
969	Of 105 @DISEASE$ and chronic HBV co-infected patients, elevated levels of liver test were seen in several patients at admission, including elevated levels of @GENE$ (22, 20.95%), aspartate aminotransferase (29, 27.62%), total bilirubin (7, 6.67%), gamma-glutamyl transferase (7, 6.67%), and alkaline phosphatase (1, 0.95%).	1
970	The SMD of @DISEASE$, GGT, @GENE$, and AST elevation in severe as compared to non-severe were - 1.05 (- 1.27 to - 0.83), 0.76 (0.40-1.12), 0.42 (0.27-0.56), and 0.69 (0.52-0.86), respectively.	1
971	Overweight/@DISEASE$ was determined as body mass index (BMI) â¥24 kg/m2, ALF was determined as @GENE$ &gt;40 U/L, and prolonged hospitalization was lasting more than the median value of the hospitalized days (19 days) in this population.	1
972	In our meta-analysis of 19 studies, which included a total of 4,103 patients, the pooled mean @GENE$ and aspartate aminotransferase levels were respectively 31.7 and 51.0 IU/L in the patients with @DISEASE$ who died and 27.7 and 32.9 IU/L in those discharged alive (both p &lt; 0.0001).	1
973	The pooled WMD of AST and @GENE$ in severe vs. mild @DISEASE$ were 12.23 (95% CI; 8.07, 16.39; p &lt; 0.01) and 8.07 (95% CI 2.55, 11.91; p &lt; 0.01), respectively.	1
974	When compared between severe and non-severe @DISEASE$ patients, the pooled ORs of elevated @GENE$, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were 2.35 (95% CI 1.38-3.98), 3.21 (95% CI 2.59-3.98), 1.87 (95% CI 1.32-2.65), and 4.83 (95% CI 2.90-8.05), respectively.	1
975	Remdesivir was interrupted before the initialy planned duration in four patients, two because of @GENE$ elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of @DISEASE$ requiring renal replacement.	1
976	Emerging data on LFTs in @DISEASE$ are heterogeneous indicating mild LFTs involvement in every fourth to fifth patients with numerical more prevalent AST over @GENE$ elevations.	1
977	A role for selenium-dependent @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ virulence.	1
978	From the results, it has been found that the proposed @GENE$-based models use simple linkage functions and are highly reliable for time series prediction of @DISEASE$ cases in India.	1
979	@GENE$-0920, an Indole Chloropyridinyl Ester, Completely Blocks @DISEASE$.	1
980	While @GENE$-0820 and the nucleotide analog remdesivir blocked @DISEASE$, viral breakthrough occurred.	1
981	While @GENE$-0820 and remdesivir blocked @DISEASE$, viral breakthrough occurred as examined with immunocytochemistry.	1
982	In contrast, @GENE$-0920 completely blocked the infectivity and cytopathic effect of @DISEASE$ without significant toxicity.	1
983	In view of this, it is plausible that the mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effect of chloroquine against @DISEASE$ involves inhibition of host @GENE$.	1
984	Is @GENE$ a molecular target of chloroquine treatment against @DISEASE$?	1
985	A diagnostic genomic signal processing (@GENE$)-based system for automatic feature analysis and detection of @DISEASE$.	1
986	Therefore, we hypothesized that redox modulators like melatonin can protect neutrophil health and functions under @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ activity-deficient conditions.	1
987	We demonstrate the dual role of melatonin, wherein it protects neutrophils from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by reducing ROS generation; in contrast, it restores neutrophil functions like phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis in @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ activity-deficient neutrophils by regulating ROS levels both in vitro and in vivo.	1
988	Amplification of human @GENE$ for appraising the accuracy of negative @DISEASE$ RT-PCR results in upper respiratory tract specimens.	1
989	Newly-diagnosed @DISEASE$ was defined by @GENE$c and fasting glucose.	1
990	Multivariate modeling was used to assess the independent association of @GENE$c levels and outpatient @DISEASE$ treatment regimen with mortality, in addition to independent effects of demographic and clinical characteristics.	1
991	The extent to which clinical and demographic factors moderate this relationship is unclear, though signals are emerging that link higher BMI and higher @GENE$c to worse outcomes in PWD with @DISEASE$.	1
992	Additionally, a significantly elevated hemoglobin A1c (@GENE$c) signified undiagnosed @DISEASE$.	1
993	BNP level showed positive correlation with @GENE$c (r = 0.49, p = 0.04) and negative correlation with delta pO2 (r = -0.52, p = 0.04) can predict reduced microvascular compliance due to @DISEASE$ contributing to hypoxia susceptibility in healthy individuals.	1
994	Random plasma glucose at 12 weeks, and fasting plasma glucose or @GENE$c at 28 weeks identify women with @DISEASE$ at risk of suboptimal pregnancy outcomes.	1
995	This was a retrospective study of @DISEASE$ patients who underwent an @GENE$c test.	1
996	The population was composed by 63.2% female individuals, age median of 66 years, @DISEASE$ duration 10.7 Â± 8.2 years and @GENE$c 7.7 Â± 1.9% (61 + 20.8 mmol/mol).	1
997	@GENE$c is a biomarker with a central role in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with @DISEASE$, although not a perfect one.	1
998	We undertook a meta-analysis on the screening and diagnostic accuracy of the haemoglobin A1c (@GENE$c) test in women with and without risk factors for @DISEASE$.	1
999	Overall (n = 120), participants had a mean age of 54.8 Â± 14.4 years-old, and @GENE$c of 9.0 Â± 1.6% (75 Â± 17.5 mmol/mol); 93% of patients showed signs of current @DISEASE$ based on the surveys measured.	1
1000	There is a growing body of evidence on the accuracy of @GENE$c as a screening and diagnostic test for @DISEASE$.	1
1001	A higher @GENE$c was associated with referable @DISEASE$.	1
1002	Among them, 51 were previously diagnosed with @DISEASE$ and 3 were newly diagnosed based on @GENE$c over 6.5%.	1
1003	Is @GENE$c an ideal biomarker of well-controlled @DISEASE$?	1
1004	A simulation model was created using glycemic data from previous disasters (taken as similar in impact to current lockdown) taking baseline @GENE$c and @DISEASE$ data from India-specific database.	1
1005	@GENE$c is more useful as a specific test at a cut-off of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) with a false positive rate of 10%, but should be supplemented by a more sensitive test to detect women with @DISEASE$.	1
1006	To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic performance of alternative diagnostic strategies to oral glucose tolerance tests, including random plasma glucose, fasting plasma glucose and @GENE$c , during the @DISEASE$.	1
1007	The @DISEASE$ and the subsequent lockdown have not adversely affected metabolic control in our patients, and indeed there appears to be an improvement in @GENE$c levels.	1
1008	@DISEASE$ results of a default in the @GENE$ synthesis.	1
1009	@GENE$ impairs hemoglobin's ability to transport oxygen, produces functional @DISEASE$, and leads to tissue hypoxia.	1
1010	Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), @GENE$, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU @DISEASE$ patients and 25 healthy individuals.	1
1011	Many patients had white blood cell counts with abnormal neutrophil and lymphocyte numbers, @GENE$ concentration, coagulation profiles, and blood biochemistry, and increased @DISEASE$ markers.	1
1012	In conclusion, NO, @GENE$ and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical @DISEASE$ disease.	1
1013	Elevated Glucose Levels Favor @DISEASE$ and Monocyte Response through a @GENE$/Glycolysis-Dependent Axis.	1

1015	This review addresses some of the pathways leading to endothelial derangement, such as complement, @GENE$, and @DISEASE$ tyrosine kinases.	1
1016	@GENE$-induced changes in monocyte metabolism by @DISEASE$ directly inhibit T cell response and reduce epithelial cell survival.	1
1017	These frequencies were higher than those found in uninfected @GENE$*02:01+ donors (â¼2.5 Ã 10-6), but low when compared to frequencies for @DISEASE$-specific (A2/M158) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific (A2/BMLF1280) (â¼1.38 Ã 10-4) populations.	1
1018	When alleles were examined simultaneously using a multiple regression model to control for confounding factors, @GENE$*44 and C*01 were still positively and independently associated with @DISEASE$: a growth rate of 16% (95%CI: 0.1-35%) per 1% point increase in B*44 prevalence; and of 19% (95%CI: 1-41%) per 1% point increase in C*01 prevalence.	1
1019	@GENE$ multifunctionality is commonly associated with the presence of flexible or disordered regions, we analyze here the intrinsic disorder predisposition of major players related to the @DISEASE$ - RAAS axis.	1
1020	Conversely, we found that @GENE$*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved @DISEASE$ peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting that it could enable cross-protective T-cell-based immunity.	1
1021	We also looked at which immune dominant regions of @DISEASE$ and other coronaviruses are recognized by Major Histocompatibility Complex (@GENE$)/Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) genes and how this could impact on subsequent disease pathogenesis.	1
1022	Our epidemiologic analysis, despite the limits of the ecological approach, is strongly suggestive of a permissive role of @GENE$*01 and B*44 towards @DISEASE$, which warrants further investigation in case-control studies.	1
1023	These viral antigens can be either recognized by the B cells or presented by @GENE$ complexes to the T cells, resulting in antibody production, increased cytokine secretion, and cytolytic activity in the acute phase of @DISEASE$.	1
1024	The association of @GENE$ alleles and its downregulated expression has been correlated with disease severity against @DISEASE$ and coronaviruses.	1
1025	Since @DISEASE$ restrains antigen presentation by downregulating @GENE$ class I and II molecules and, therefore, inhibits the T cell-mediated immune responses, humoral immune responses also play a substantial role.	1
1026	In the context of specific immune response against the virus, a correlation between Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I (@GENE$-I) and the severity of the disease in patients with @DISEASE$ has been suggested.	1
1027	Being aware of the intrinsic limitations of in silico analysis (mainly the differences between the real and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure; and accuracy of the methods for simulate proteasome cleavage), we identified 24 epitopes able to interact with 17 @GENE$-I more frequent alleles in the Brazilian population that could be useful for the development of strategic methods for vaccines against @DISEASE$.	1
1028	Taking the data deposited in the GISAID database, we made predictions using the IEDB analysis resource (TepiTool) to gauge how variants in the @DISEASE$ genome may change peptide binding to the most frequent @GENE$-class I and -II alleles in Africa, Asia and Europe.	1
1029	@GENE$ 4-digit typing along with viral sequence analysis should be considered in studies examining clinical outcomes in patients with @DISEASE$.	1
1030	The present study shows, by in silico analysis, that these common human viruses are expected to induce immune memory against @DISEASE$ by sharing protein fragments (antigen epitopes) for presentation to the immune system by @GENE$ class I. A list of such epitopes is provided.	1
1031	We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, and Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of @DISEASE$ based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and @GENE$/paratope binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects.	1
1032	Computationally Optimized @DISEASE$ @GENE$ Class I and II Vaccine Formulations Predicted to Target Human Haplotype Distributions.	1
1033	@GENE$: A Possible Crucial Therapeutic Target for @DISEASE$?	1
1034	It is conceivable that extracellular @DISEASE$ RNA may reach the cellular cytosol via @GENE$-assisted transfer combined with lysosome leakage.	1
1035	They have been shown to act against the priming of @DISEASE$ attachment proteins by host and viral enzymes, and the release of @GENE$ by host immune cells.	1
1036	Based on these observations we propose extracellular @GENE$ to be considered as a therapeutic target for @DISEASE$.	1
1037	The increase in @GENE$ and NETosis could lead to sustained inflammation due to @DISEASE$.	1
1038	As competitive inhibitors of @GENE$, the key enzyme of the   mevalonate pathway   through which essential compounds, not only cholesterol, are synthesized, statins decrease the levels of cholesterol, and thus LDLs, as an innate defense mechanism, with controversial results in decreasing mortality from @DISEASE$.	1
1039	There is a potential role for @GENE$ upregulation to treat/prevent @DISEASE$.	1
1040	The @DISEASE$ open reading frame 3 a (ORF3a) protein was found to bind to the human @GENE$ at a high confidence through high-throughput screening experiments.	1
1041	The role of carbon monoxide and @GENE$ in @DISEASE$.	1
1042	We propose that subjects with @DISEASE$, old age, and male gender have the greatest morbidity and mortality and have low stress proteins, in particular, low intracellular heme oxygenase (@GENE$), making them particularly vulnerable to the disease.	1
1043	The @GENE$ pathway can inhibit platelet aggregation, and can have anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties, amongst others, all of which are critical medical conditions observed in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
1044	We therefore postulate that free heme contributes to many of the inflammatory phenomena witnessed in critically ill @DISEASE$ patients, whilst induction of @GENE$ or harnessing heme may provide protection.	1
1045	Additionally, @DISEASE$'s heme reduction may contribute to even lower @GENE$.	1
1046	Controlled trials of these @GENE$ inducers should be done in order to prevent or treat @DISEASE$ disease.	1
1047	Intestinal receptor of @DISEASE$ in inflamed IBD tissue seems downregulated by @GENE$ in ileum and upregulated by interferon regulating factors in colon.	1
1048	Next-generation sequencing of the harvested sample was carried out to observe the expression pattern of the virus by mapping to the @DISEASE$ Wuhan @GENE$ reference sequence.	1
1049	The current outbreak of @DISEASE$ was estimated to have originated on 12/11/2019 (95% @GENE$ 11/13/2019-12/23/2019).	1
1050	Equally, it is important that expert advice from intestinal failure teams is available when home parenteral nutrition (@GENE$)-dependent patients require admission with @DISEASE$.	1
1051	Is There a Role for @GENE$ Program Implementation to Restart Bariatric Surgery After the Peak of @DISEASE$?	1
1052	The present study indicates that changes toward a higher number of HRBs than before confinement, as well as the prevalence of each @GENE$ except screen exposure, decreased during the first 3 weeks of @DISEASE$ confinement, and thus the Spanish adult population may have adapted to the new situational context by gradually improving their health behaviors.	1
1053	Among 4,689 @GENE$-seasons, we detected @DISEASE$ in 387 (8%).	1
1054	We suggest that further work should be urgently carried out to confirm if @GENE$ is indeed a good molecular target and if some of those drugs have potential to be repurposed for @DISEASE$ antiviral activity.	1
1055	Recently, surface @GENE$ has been reported to be a potential receptor of some viruses, including the novel @DISEASE$.	1
1056	Preliminary Virtual Screening Studies to Identify @GENE$ Inhibitors Which May Interfere with @DISEASE$.	1
1057	A possible role for @GENE$ in cross vaccination against @DISEASE$.	1
1058	Serum @GENE$ level median value was statistically significantly higher in @DISEASE$-positive group compared to the other groups (p=0.0003).	1
1059	Surface @GENE$ has been proposed to have various roles, such as receptor-mediated signal transduction, a co-receptor for soluble ligands, as well as a participant in @DISEASE$ survival, proliferation, and resistance.	1
1060	In addition, we aimed to identify drugs that could be repurposed to inhibit @GENE$, thus with potential anti-@DISEASE$ activity.	1
1061	The stress-inducible molecular chaperone @GENE$ as potential therapeutic target for @DISEASE$.	1
1062	In this regard, pharmacological inhibition of @GENE$ could attract attention to potentially ameliorate inappropriate inflammatory reaction in severe @DISEASE$ patients.	1
1063	A dermatopathological biopsy suggested a bullous drug reaction with an @DISEASE$-like reaction pattern versus @GENE$/TEN.	1
1064	These findings differed from those for @GENE$, where gene expression was increased in @DISEASE$ and less consistent differences were observed related to sex, race, and use of ICS.	1
1065	Using confirmatory factor analysis, the factor structure of the IES-@DISEASE$ was found to be similar to the original IES, indicating two latent factors: intrusion and avoidance, Ï2 (85) = 147.51, @GENE$ = .92, TLI = .90, RMSEA = .044, SRMR = .049.	1
1066	The results support a bifactor model consisting of one general factor and two specific factors-one of emotional fear reactions and another of somatic expressions of fear of @DISEASE$ (@GENE$ = 0.988, RMSEA = 0.075).	1
1067	Given the significance of TLSs in mucosal immunity, their association with positive prognosis and response to immune checkpoint blockade with a critical role of Type I interferon (@GENE$) in inducing these, we also discuss potentiating TLS formation as a promising approach to enhance anti-@DISEASE$.	1
1068	We propose that lessons learned from BCG immunotherapy success could be applied to not only augment such microbe-based therapeutics but also lead to similar adjunctive @GENE$ activating approaches to improve response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in @DISEASE$.	1
1069	Here, we investigated properties of type I (Î²), II (Î³), and III (Î»1) interferons (IFNs), potent immune cytokines that are normally produced during @DISEASE$ and that upregulate @GENE$-stimulated gene (ISG) effectors to limit virus replication.	1
1070	Type I @GENE$ deficiency: an immunological characteristic of severe @DISEASE$ patients.	1
1071	Based on this, we propose that the type I @GENE$ response plays a pivotal role in exacerbating inflammation in severe @DISEASE$.	1
1072	Herein, we report the sensitivity of @DISEASE$ to recombinant human interferons Î± and Î² (@GENE$/Î²).	1
1073	A suppression of the @GENE$-I response has been noted in @DISEASE$.	1
1074	However, coronaviruses similar to @DISEASE$ can suppress host @GENE$-I antiviral responses.	1
1075	@GENE$-induced protein p53 directly reduces epithelial proliferation and differentiation, which increases disease severity and susceptibility to bacterial @DISEASE$.	1
1076	Thus, excessive or prolonged @GENE$ production aggravates @DISEASE$ by impairing lung epithelial regeneration.	1
1077	Although there are ongoing clinical trials to test the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis, there has not been any proposal to test the efficacy of @GENE$ Î±-2b together with hydroxychloroquine to increase protection against @DISEASE$.	1
1078	Type I @GENE$ immunoprofiling in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
1079	Combination antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol and @GENE$ for @DISEASE$.	1
1080	In this Viewpoint, we present our opinion on the benefits and potential limitations of using @GENE$-Î» to prevent, limit, and treat these dangerous @DISEASE$.	1
1081	These results indicate that @DISEASE$ in HIV-1-positive female patient was associated with increased levels of @GENE$/Î²-mRNAs and T cell activation compared to healthy individuals.	1
1082	In mice, we demonstrate that @GENE$-Î» produced by lung dendritic cells in response to a synthetic viral RNA induces barrier damage, causing susceptibility to lethal bacterial @DISEASE$.	1
1083	In this review, we describe the recent progress in our understanding of both type I and type III @GENE$-mediated innate antiviral responses against human coronaviruses and discuss the potential use of IFNs as a treatment strategy for @DISEASE$.	1
1084	Analysing the basic biology of single diseases, the data suggest that there is an   immunological umbrella   that seems to protect against the @DISEASE$, through @GENE$ type 1 and NK cell function.	1
1085	Interestingly, we documented type I @GENE$-driven inflammatory features in patients with severe @DISEASE$ as well.	1
1086	Interestingly, the combination of 100 Î¼M of HCQ and 104 U/mL of recombinant feline @GENE$-Ï (rfIFN-Ï, veterinary registered drug) increased its antiviral activity against type I FIPV @DISEASE$.	1
1087	Single-cell transcriptomics revealed a lack of type I IFNs, reduced HLA-DR in the myeloid cells of patients with severe @DISEASE$, and transient expression of @GENE$-stimulated genes.	1
1088	Here, we observed the distribution of MERS-CoV receptors using human respiratory mucosa and also evaluated the contribution of interferon-lambdas (@GENE$-Î»s) in response to MERS-CoV @DISEASE$ using in vitro normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) and bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells.	1
1089	Various interferon (@GENE$)-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins for @DISEASE$, is there a role for the combination of mycophenolic acid and interferon?	1
1090	In contrast, @DISEASE$-1 was restricted only by @GENE$ in these cell lines.	1
1091	An unbalanced immune response, characterized by a @DISEASE$ production of type I interferons (@GENE$-Is) and an exacerbated release of proinflammatory cytokines, contributes to the severe forms of the disease.	1
1092	Here, we describe our current knowledge of the complex interplay between @DISEASE$ and the @GENE$ system, highlighting some of the gaps that need to be filled for a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms.	1
1093	@DISEASE$ can effectively suppress the anti-viral @GENE$ response in monocytes and macrophages.	1
1094	We discuss the unique role of IFNÎ» in fine-tuning antiviral immunity in the respiratory tract to achieve optimal protection and minimal host damage and review early evidence that @DISEASE$ may impair IFNÎ» induction, leading to a delayed type I @GENE$-dominated response that triggers hyperinflammation and severe disease.	1
1095	Viral-Track detects an unexpected @DISEASE$ of the human metapneumovirus, present mainly in monocytes perturbed in type-I interferon (@GENE$)-signaling.	1
1096	Type 1 interferons (@GENE$-I) are a family cytokines of the early innate immune response to viruses that are being tested against @DISEASE$.	1
1097	The induction of IFNs was identified in NHNE and NHBE cells after MERS-CoV @DISEASE$ and @GENE$-Î»s were predominantly increased in MERS-CoV-infected respiratory epithelial cells.	1
1098	We describe here the effects of treatment with interferon (@GENE$)-Î±2b in a cohort of confirmed @DISEASE$ cases in Wuhan, China.	1
1099	In addition, the evidence suggests that @GENE$ type I and III can play an important role in controlling viremia and modulating the immune response in @DISEASE$.	1
1100	Thus, @GENE$-Î» has a decisive function in the respiratory epithelium that greatly limits MERS-CoV replication, and may be a key cytokine for better therapeutic outcomes against MERS-CoV @DISEASE$ in respiratory tract.	1
1101	PEDV @DISEASE$ does not elicit a robust @GENE$ response, and some of the mechanisms used by the virus to counteract the host innate immune response have been unraveled.	1
1102	This finding suggests that type I and especially the less adverse effect-prone type III @GENE$ are good candidates for the management of @DISEASE$.	1
1103	@GENE$ is more effective in the early stage of @DISEASE$.	1
1104	The outcome of treatment indicated that in patients with the common-type @DISEASE$, @GENE$, but not novaferon, had some benefits, antibiotics treatment was not needed, and corticosteroids should be used cautiously.	1
1105	@GENE$b spray inhalation did not shorten virus shedding time of @DISEASE$ in hospitalized patients.	1
1106	Arbidol/@GENE$b therapy for patients with @DISEASE$: a retrospective multicenter cohort study.	1
1107	These findings suggest that @GENE$b should be further investigated as a therapy in @DISEASE$ cases.	1
1108	@GENE$ spray inhalation did not shorten virus shedding time of @DISEASE$ in hospitalized patients: a preliminary matched case-control study.	1
1109	Use of hydroxychloroquine and @GENE$ for the prophylaxis of @DISEASE$.	1
1110	To examine the association between the use and timing of @GENE$b and clinical outcomes, we analyzed in a retrospective multicenter cohort study of 446 @DISEASE$ patients in Hubei, China.	1
1111	We concluded that administration of @GENE$b during the early stage of @DISEASE$ could induce favorable clinical responses.	1

1134	The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of @GENE$-1a administration in @DISEASE$.	1
1135	In this review, we summarized the pharmacogenomic literature available for @DISEASE$ drug therapies including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat, @GENE$b, tocilizumab, ruxolitinib, baricitinib, and corticosteroids.	1

1152	This case highlights the high tolerability and the interesting immunomodulatory profile of the @GENE$ antagonist anakinra in the setting of severe @DISEASE$ associated with remdesivir therapy.	1
1153	However, the role of anti-@GENE$ antibodies, such as anakinra, in the treatment of @DISEASE$ has not been established.	1

1580	In 2016, the @GENE$-II Joint Statement recognized the importance of metabolic surgery in the treatment of @DISEASE$ and urged clinicians to discuss, recommend, or at least consider this procedure for their patients.	1
1581	We assume the extensive pediatric vaccination with @GENE$ vaccines followed globally could have resulted in innate immune responses, e.g., induction of interferons (IFNs) and activated natural killer (NK) cells, thereby offering natural immunity against @DISEASE$ in the young population.	1
1582	Vaccination with @GENE$ in immunocompetent individuals has no contraindications and may be especially effective for health care workers who can easily be exposed to @DISEASE$.	1
1583	Vaccine repurposing approach for preventing @DISEASE$: can @GENE$ vaccines reduce morbidity and mortality?	1
1584	Following the lead of other countries conducting clinical trials with the live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG) vaccine under a similar concept, a clinical trial with @GENE$ in high-risk populations may provide a   low-risk-high-reward   preventive measure in saving lives during this unprecedented @DISEASE$.	1
1585	Therefore, the morality rate based @GENE$ model is selected for the @DISEASE$ death rate in Pakistan.	1
1586	Moreover, 4 specific ingredients (M3, S1, X2 and O2) and 5 common ingredients (@GENE$, MX16, SX1, WO1 and XO1) of QFPD presented good molecular docking score for @DISEASE$ structure and non-structure proteins.	1

1590	For the FIA IgG test, all patients in the @DISEASE$ group exhibited a high @GENE$ value (â¥15.0), while 89.8% of mild symptomatic and 73.3% of asymptomatic/anosmia groups showed a high value (p = 0.049).	1
1591	The inter-assay precision was 2.9% for a negative control (@GENE$=0.1) and 5.1% for a positive control (@DISEASE$=3.0).	1
1592	In addition, the hybrid compounds, such as @GENE$ inhibitors/TP antagonists, can be an innovative treatment to control the overall balance between AA mediators in patients with @DISEASE$.	1
1593	Further studies will be certainly needed to better define the role of NSAIDs and particularly @GENE$ inhibitors in patients with @DISEASE$.	1
1594	The data elucidated that @GENE$ and prostaglandins (PGs), particularly PGE2, have pro-inflammatory action in @DISEASE$ pathophysiology.	1

1599	In conclusion, @GENE$ could be an indicator to evaluate the progression of @DISEASE$, which is parallel to the level of lung injury and inflammation in patients.	1
1600	@GENE$-Database published the first early access pediatric-related @DISEASE$ articles on March 13th, two days following the World Health Organization's declaration of a global pandemic.	1

1603	Serum @GENE$ level is a useful biomarker for evaluating the severity of @DISEASE$.	1
1604	Serum @GENE$ can distinguish between different phenotypes of severe @DISEASE$.	1
1605	This is a mystery, because sugar binding activities appear essential to many other viruses including @DISEASE$ and even most other coronaviruses in order to bind to and escape from the glycans (sugars, oligosaccharides or polysaccharides) characteristic of cell surfaces and saliva and @GENE$.	1
1606	Major pathological findings included epidermal basal layer vacuolation, papillary dermis oedema and erythrocyte extravasation, perivascular and perieccrine dermal @DISEASE$, and @GENE$ deposition in the dermis and hypodermis; dermal vessel thrombi were observed in two cases.	1
1607	Only variants in @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ were found as possibly implicated in CoV-associated phenotypes in at least two studies.	1
1608	Together, our data strongly suggest that ATV and @GENE$/RTV should be considered among the candidate repurposed drugs undergoing clinical trials in the fight against @DISEASE$.	1

1616	These molecules mitigated inflammatory cytokine cascades induced by @DISEASE$ via @GENE$ activating capacity and might have additional anti-fibrotic and anti-remodeling properties.	1
1617	Disease severity may also be modulated by pre-existing conditions, such as impaired immune response, @DISEASE$, and age, where decreased level of @GENE$ is a common feature.	1

1619	Can Activation of @GENE$ Be a Strategy against @DISEASE$?	1
1620	The induced oxidative stress stimulates a local innate response via activation of the toll-like receptors and the @GENE$. Those kinds of reactions are also activated by @DISEASE$.	1
1621	Phillyrin (KD-1) exerts anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities against novel coronavirus (@DISEASE$) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) by suppressing the nuclear factor kappa B (@GENE$) signaling pathway.	1
1622	Additionally, in vitro evidence suggests that inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor-ÎºB (@GENE$) by ibuprofen may have a role in reducing excess inflammation or cytokine release in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
1623	As per the results, Prevotella proteins, but not viral proteins, are involved in multiple interactions with @GENE$, which is involved in increasing clinical severity of @DISEASE$.	1
1624	Liu Shen capsule shows antiviral and anti-inflammatory abilities against novel coronavirus @DISEASE$ via suppression of @GENE$ signaling pathway.	1
1625	Impact of @DISEASE$ on post-graduate orthopaedic training in Delhi-@GENE$.	1
1626	@DISEASE$ has severely disrupted the education and training of the Orthopaedic PG students, in Delhi-@GENE$ region and perhaps elsewhere similarly too.	1
1627	Simultaneously, the ORF and @GENE$ variation of @DISEASE$ were found.	1
1628	Our overall aim is to suggest that pharmacological interventions targeting lysosomal function in general, and those particularly capable of reversibly inducing transient @GENE$-like cellular and biochemical phenotypes, constitute plausible mechanisms that could be used to therapeutically target @DISEASE$.	1
1629	Antiviral effects of @GENE$-inhibiting drugs for @DISEASE$ treatment should be explored.	1
1630	Evidence has accumulated that @GENE$ administered to pulmonary endothelial cells, isolated lungs, and patients suffering from @DISEASE$ reduces endothelial damage and preserves the endothelial barrier, thereby reducing pulmonary edema and inflammation.	1
1631	Laboratory evaluations revealed elevated troponin T and @GENE$, with an echocardiogram indicating global @DISEASE$ and a reduced ejection fraction.	1
1632	Their levels of @DISEASE$, sadness, fear and worry were measured with @GENE$-Q1 before and after MT intervention.	1
1633	Arg130His in @GENE$) may have predictive value for inter-individual differences in the response to the @DISEASE$.	1
1634	May we target double-membrane vesicles and @GENE$ to combat @DISEASE$?	1
1635	Can intravenous @GENE$ infusion counteract hyperinflammation in @DISEASE$ infected patients?	1
1636	There is significant data showing @GENE$ would be useful for treatment of @DISEASE$ pathogenesis.	1
1637	The neuropeptide @GENE$ has attracted great attention of the general public, basic neuroscience researchers, psychologists, and psychiatrists due to its profound pro-social, anxiolytic, and   anti-stress   behavioral and physiological effects, and its potential application for treatment of @DISEASE$ associated with altered socio-emotional competence.	1
1638	A rationale for targeting the @GENE$ in @DISEASE$.	1
1639	The potential involvement of @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ pathogenesis: A new therapeutic target?	1
1640	Here, we identified two deletion variants of @DISEASE$ that either directly affect the @GENE$-like cleavage site itself (NSPRRAR) or a flanking sequence (QTQTN), and we investigated these deletions in cell isolates and clinical samples.	1
1641	Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the @GENE$ cleavage site of the S glycoprotein, a leading vaccine target, shows that this and other regions of @DISEASE$ proteins may readily mutate.	1
1642	The @GENE$ site directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit and likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and @DISEASE$ of this virus.	1
1643	So, @GENE$ inhibitors can be targeted as potential drug therapies for @DISEASE$.	1
1644	Is @GENE$ expression in salivary glands related to @DISEASE$ infectivity through saliva?	1
1645	Cleavage of the S glycoprotein in @DISEASE$-infected Vero E6 cell lysates was inefficient even when an intact @GENE$ cleavage signal was present.	1
1646	Chinese herbal derived luteolin is suggested to be putative @GENE$ inhibitor, with previous success against @DISEASE$.	1
1647	Our results revealed that the @GENE$ cleavage site might not be required for @DISEASE$ to enter human cells in vivo.	1
1648	Furthermore, @DISEASE$ replication was also strongly inhibited by the synthetic @GENE$ inhibitor MI-1851 in human airway cells.	1
1649	Our results suggest that acquisition of a S1/S2 multibasic cleavage site was essential for @DISEASE$ of humans and identify @GENE$ as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.	1
1650	@GENE$, a cleavage enzyme, is increasingly recognized in the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$.	1
1651	Both Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 lost the putative @GENE$ recognition sequence motif at S1/S2 cleavage site that can be observed in the @DISEASE$.	1
1652	The S protein modified in @GENE$ protease-target site was efficiently secreted to silkworm serum and was purified as oligomers, which showed immunoreactivity for anti-@DISEASE$ S2 antibody.	1
1653	@DISEASE$ contains the @GENE$ cleavage PRRA motif in the S1/S2 region, which enhances viral pathogenicity but is absent in closely related bat and pangolin coronaviruses.	1
1654	Immediate availability for targeted experimental and clinical interrogations of potential @DISEASE$ mitigation agents, namely vitamin D and quercetin, as well as of the highly selective (Ki, 600 pm) intrinsically specific @GENE$ inhibitor (a1-antitrypsin Portland (a1-PDX), is considered an encouraging factor.	1
1655	However, the @DISEASE$ spike (S) glycoprotein has a novel insertion that generates a putative @GENE$ cleavage signal and this has been postulated to expand the host range.	1
1656	Nicotine patches and Colchicine have also been suggested as potential therapies due to @GENE$ mediated inhibition of @DISEASE$.	1
1657	Furthermore, it seems that @GENE$ is implicated in the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$ and potentially in the increased rates of human-to-human transmission.	1
1658	This @GENE$-mediated endothelial tropism seems to underlie the multi-organ system involvement of @DISEASE$; which is a feature that was not recognized in the older versions of coronaviridae.	1
1659	In contrast, smoking decreases cellular levels of @GENE$, this finding may be at the origin of the decreased severity of @DISEASE$ in smokers.	1
1660	We report that @DISEASE$ has evolved a unique S1/S2 cleavage site, absent in any previous coronavirus sequenced, resulting in the striking mimicry of an identical @GENE$-cleavable peptide on the human epithelial sodium channel Î±-subunit (ENaC-Î±).	1
1661	This simple and straightforward method involved the coupling of 2,3-dichloroquinoxaline with commercially available terminal alkynes in the presence of CuI, @DISEASE$ and K2CO3 in @GENE$-400.	1
1662	This review provides new insights into the primary concentration methods that have been adopted by the eighteen recently reported @DISEASE$ wastewater detection studies, along with a brief discussion of the mechanisms of the most commonly used virus concentration methods, including the @GENE$-based separation, electrostatically charged membrane filtration, and ultrafiltration.	1
1663	Remote Administration of the @GENE$-UPDRS in the Time of @DISEASE$ and Beyond.	1
1664	Thus, as alternative potentially more direct   broad-spectrum   signalling mechanism-based @DISEASE$ therapeutics, several natural and synthetic @GENE$-blockers such as propolis, melatonin, ciclesonide, hydroxy chloroquine (HQ), ivermection, and ketorolac, which are readily available in the market, are introduced here.	1
1665	@GENE$-blockers: Potential Therapeutics against @DISEASE$.	1
1666	This mechanism involves @GENE$ overexpression, which is a kinase that mediates coronavirus-induced @DISEASE$, fibrosis, and immune system suppression.	1
1667	At baseline, the patients showed a pro-coagulant profile characterized by an increased clot strength (CS, median 55 hPa, 95% interquartile range 35-63), platelet contribution to CS (@GENE$, 43 hPa; interquartile range 24-45), fibrinogen contribution to CS (FCS, 12 hPa; interquartile range 6-13.5) elevated D-dimer levels (5.5 Î¼g/mL, interquartile range 2.5-6.5), and @DISEASE$ (794 mg/dL, interquartile range 583-933).	1
1668	The VEHD protocol is a simple, four-step algorithm designed to accurately and efficiently identify low-risk @DISEASE$ patients that can be safely discharged between 20 and 36 hours after successful primary @GENE$.	1
1669	Also, with a high probability of the angiogram showing non-obstructed coronary arteries during @DISEASE$, primary @GENE$ should be the preferred strategy.	1
1670	To ensure that patients have a thorough understanding of their treatment and expected outcome during the current @DISEASE$ crisis there may be merit in the use of the HaNC-AD @GENE$.	1
1671	Exploring Personal Protection During High-Risk @GENE$ in a @DISEASE$ Patient: Impella CP Mechanical Support During ULMCA Bifurcation Stenting.	1
1672	@DISEASE$ more frequently received primary @GENE$ (81.8% vs 78.8%%), thrombolysis was negligible (0.5% vs. 0.3%), median admission-to-coronary angiography duration for NSTEMI decreased (26.2 vs. 64.0 hours), median duration of hospitalisation decreased (4 to 2 days), secondary prevention pharmacotherapy prescription remained unchanged (each &gt;94.7%).	1
1673	In this review, we outline the risk and benefits of primary @GENE$ vs. thrombolysis for @DISEASE$.	1
1674	The study was conducted on Autodock vina software using @DISEASE$ Mpro as a target protein having @GENE$ ID: 6LU7.	1
1675	All the studied molecules could bind to the active site of the @DISEASE$ protease (@GENE$: 6Y84), out of which rutin (a natural compound) has the highest inhibitor efficiency among the 33 molecules studied, followed by ritonavir (control drug), emetine (anti-protozoal), hesperidin (a natural compound), lopinavir (control drug) and indinavir (anti-viral drug).	1
1676	This review also reports the rationale for a possible use of drugs commonly employed in neoplastic therapy, such as bevacizumab, ibrutinib, selinexor, thalidomide, carfilzomib, and @GENE$ inhibitors, for the treatment of @DISEASE$.	1
1677	T cells from @DISEASE$ patients had significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker @GENE$.	1
1678	Furthermore, multiple animal models demonstrate strong anti-inflammatory effects of @GENE$i in respiratory models of viral and @DISEASE$ and also after chemically mediated lung injury.	1
1679	The rationale for @GENE$i use in @DISEASE$ patients comes from the multimodal mechanism of action with cytokine, chemokine, and other key pathway inhibition all achieved with an excellent safety profile.	1
1680	In conclusion, over-exuberant anti-viral immune responses in older patients with @DISEASE$ may pose a substantial risk to patient survival and mitigation against such hyper-inflammation with @GENE$i, especially with anti-viral agents, is a strategy that need to be pursed, especially in older patients.	1
1681	Case studies involving @DISEASE$ incidence time series from countries around the world suggest the usefulness of the proposed framework in comparison with some of the main epidemic models from the literature (e.g. SIR, @GENE$, SEIR) and established time series formalisms (e.g. exponential smoothing - ETS, autoregressive integrated moving average - ARIMA).	1
1682	Between days 11 and 12 of hospitalization, platelet count dropped from 304 000 to 96 000 cells/ÂµL. He had a high pretest probability for @DISEASE$ with a 4T score of 6 and a positive anti-@GENE$/heparin antibody.	1
1683	Detection of anti-heparin-@GENE$ complex antibodies in @DISEASE$ patients on heparin therapy.	1
1684	Pregnant women with severe @DISEASE$ can develop a PE-like syndrome that might be distinguished from actual PE by sFlt-1/@GENE$, LDH and UtAPI assessment.	1
1685	The gene detection for @DISEASE$ guidance showed the genetic locus @GENE$ (<span class='variant' id='g SUB T 3435 C__DNAMutation-10-73-80'>3435T&gt;C</span>) <span class='variant' id='__SNP-10-82-91'>rs1045642</span> belonged to type CC and it mean the efficiency of lopinavir-ritonavir would be significantly decreased.	1

1687	Possible role of @GENE$ in lysosomal accumulation of azithromycin in @DISEASE$ therapy.	1

1692	In addition, clinical findings indicate that @GENE$ levels might be important in defining Covid-19 outcomes, potentially partially explaining associations with air pollution and with @DISEASE$.	1
1693	An update on @DISEASE$ for the otorhinolaryngologist - a Brazilian Association of Otolaryngology and Cervicofacial Surgery (ABORL-@GENE$) Position Statement.	1
1694	We are still at the beginning of the @DISEASE$ and scientific evidence is still scarce and incomplete, so these ABORL-@GENE$ recommendations for otorhinolaryngologists may be updated based on new knowledge and the pattern of the new coronavirus spread.	1
1695	Interferon-responsive @GENE$ cells were infected with these viruses and produced higher levels of interferon responses than were seen with wild-type icPEDV @DISEASE$.	1
1696	It is unclear to what extent @GENE$ may impact population-based survival during the current US @DISEASE$.	1
1697	The percentage of patients for whom we recommended urgent @DISEASE$ treatment with intravenous @GENE$, mechanical thrombectomy, or both decreased from 44.4% (28 of 63) to 33.3% (11 of 33).	1
1698	Revascularization was performed in 13 (27%) patients, primary @DISEASE$ in 5 (10%), administration of systemic @GENE$ in 3 (6%), and 28 (57%) were treated with systemic anticoagulation only.	1
1699	The patient arrived 1 h after onset of symptoms, was treated with recombinant @GENE$ (rtPA) with improvement of neurologic deficits, and later developed right foot @DISEASE$ (recanalized by balloon catheter angioplasty) and left arm superficial venous thrombosis.	1
1700	Nonetheless, in March, we had 12 patients eligible for @GENE$, which is twice the typical caseload and was unexpected given the low overall @DISEASE$ presentations.	1
1701	Hospitalized patients with @DISEASE$ should be placed on thromboprophylaxis with the option of full therapeutic anticoagulation or @GENE$ in high-risk or mechanically ventilated patients.	1
1702	@GENE$ is an approved intravenous thrombolytic treatment, and the nebulizer form has been shown to be effective in @DISEASE$ and is currently in Phase II clinical trial.	1
1703	Amongst these changes, updates in hospital transport guidelines and practices related to IV-@GENE$ and MT may affect the perceived care and outcome of @DISEASE$ patients.	1
1704	The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence for the existence of elevated @GENE$(ogen) in @DISEASE$ patients with these comorbid conditions.	1

1724	In 2016, the @GENE$-II Joint Statement recognized the importance of metabolic surgery in the treatment of @DISEASE$ and urged clinicians to discuss, recommend, or at least consider this procedure for their patients.	1
1725	Cetilistat (anti-@GENE$), diiodohydroxyquinoline (anti-parasitic), abiraterone acetate (synthetic androstane steroid), and bexarotene (antineoplastic retinoid) exhibited potent in vitro anti-@DISEASE$ activity (EC50 1.13-2.01 Î¼M).	1
