@GENE$/LYM is a highly sensitive indicator to assess the severity of @DISEASE$ in the early stage of disease.	1
It was found that 96.8% and 72.4% of patients present with @GENE$ level and @DISEASE$, respectively, and 70.6% of kidney recipients patients presented with high creatinine levels.	1
On laboratory evaluation, many patients present with @DISEASE$ and increased @GENE$, which are both associated with inferior outcomes.	1
The commonest laboratory abnormalities were raised @GENE$ or procalcitonin (54.0%), @DISEASE$ (34.2%) and elevated transaminases (16.0%).	1
Further, the @DISEASE$ patients whose illness entered 7-10 days, age &gt; 50 years, and elevated @GENE$ levels should be given additional medical considerations.	1
An high @GENE$ value and abnormalities of chest X-ray (@DISEASE$) were detected in 26.2% and 19% of patients, respectively.	1
However, @GENE$ could not predict the recovery of @DISEASE$.	1
Mortality was associated with those that were admitted to ICU (19% vs 0; p=0.009), mechanically ventilated (31% vs 0; p=0.001), had @DISEASE$ (20% vs 2.3%; p=0.032), older (62 vs 47 years; p=0.045), had high total bilirubin (43% vs 2.3%; p=0.007) and those with high @GENE$ (186 vs 90mg/dL; p=0.009) and low corrected calcium (15% vs 0%; p=0.047).	1
Insights into @GENE$ structure-function relationships have uncovered both pro- and anti-inflammatory isoforms that may be used to monitor the extent of tissue damage associated with @DISEASE$ pathologies and prognoses.	1
Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts, elevated levels of @GENE$ and @DISEASE$, confirming the viral origin of the disease.	1
@DISEASE$ (&lt;1.0 Ã 10 cells/L) was identified in 6 of 10 patients, 9 of 9 patients had a high serum level of D-dimer, and 9 of 9 patients had a high level of @GENE$.	1
A higher proportion of PLH group needed inpatient services (19.31% vs 11.39%, RR 1.696, 95% CI: 1.21 - 2.38).Mean @GENE$, ferritin, ESR and LDH levels after @DISEASE$ diagnosis were not statistically different and mortality was not different for PLH with history of anti-retroviral treatment.	1
Thombocytosis, @DISEASE$, and increased @GENE$ were common lab findings although most patients included in the overall analysis did not have laboratory values reported.	1
As the worsening of severity, the positive rates of @GENE$ and @DISEASE$ also showed trends of increase.	1
Different @GENE$/@DISEASE$ type showed associations with viral loads in patients in different severity and different time after onset.	1
Most of them had several comorbidities, and all had multiple biological abnormalities (@DISEASE$, increased @GENE$, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, liver enzymes).	1
ROC curves showed a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 70% for the LDH cut-off value of 450 U/L and a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 71% for the @GENE$ cut-off value of 11 mg/dl in identifying CoVID-19 with moderate-severe @DISEASE$.	1
The pooled area under the @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ curves were 0.70 (0.64-0.76) and 0.89 (0.80-0.99), respectively.	1
There was an important gain in oxygenation (P/F 300), a decrease of @GENE$ values, and a decrease of the @DISEASE$.	1
Compared with the common type, there was significant difference in the white blood cell and lymphocyte counts in the severe type (P&lt;0.01); the @DISEASE$ indicators, such as hypersensitivity @GENE$ and serum ferritin, were significantly increased, with significant difference (all P&lt;0.01); but the procalcitonin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was not significantly different (both P&gt;0.05).	1
At baseline, all patients had multiple biological abnormalities (@DISEASE$, increased @GENE$, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer and liver enzymes).	1
Multivariable regression demonstrated increasing odds of severity associated with the duration of @DISEASE$ (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.10-1.82, per day increase; p=0Â·007), @GENE$ (1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52; p=0.02), and PO2 &lt;80 mmHg (28.07, 95% CI 1.50-524.12; p=0.026) on admission.	1
First-in-Man: Case Report of Selective @GENE$ Apheresis in a Patient with @DISEASE$.	1
CONCLUSIONS This is the first report on @GENE$ apheresis in a @DISEASE$ patient.	1
The signature of @DISEASE$ was combined with five indicators, namely neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin, older age, and @GENE$.	1
Males were more likely to have liver injury when infected with @DISEASE$ (P &lt; .05); compared with patients without liver injury, patients with liver injury had increased levels of white blood cell counts, neutrophils, @GENE$ and CT score (P &lt; .05) and had a longer length of stay (P &lt; .05).	1
Mild patients had low to moderate @DISEASE$ (&lt;39.1 Â°C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased @GENE$.	1
The levels of @GENE$ and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest a typical @DISEASE$.	1
We aimed to assess the usefulness of @GENE$ levels in the early stage of @DISEASE$ and to correlate them with lung lesions and severe presentation.	1
In the early stage of @DISEASE$ @GENE$ levels were positively correlated with lung lesions and could reflect disease severity.	1
Abnormal white blood cell counts have poor sensitivity for @DISEASE$; procalcitonin and @GENE$ levels, when available, are more informative.	1
The aim of the present study was to estimate whether the @GENE$ level is able to act as a marker in indicating the severity of @DISEASE$.	1
@GENE$, procalcitonin, d-dimer, and @DISEASE$-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients.	1
In regard to the hematological parameters, @DISEASE$ patients showed decreased erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, and complement C1q, whereas neutrophils, @GENE$, and procalcitonin were significantly increased, especially in severe cases.	1
Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and @GENE$ were found in postpartum blood tests of @DISEASE$ patients.	1
Kinetics of temperature, @GENE$, and lymphocyte counts mirrored the remitting/relapsing @DISEASE$.	1
On admission, the levels of SpO2, lymphocyte, @GENE$, PCT, and LDH could predict the prognosis of severe @DISEASE$ patients.	1
During the second episode, there was serological evidence of elevated @GENE$ and @DISEASE$ IgG seroconversion.	1
Levels of @GENE$, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = 0.37, P = 0.003, Spearman's correlation) of patients who presented @DISEASE$.	1
Moreover, the change of @GENE$ level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of @DISEASE$.	1
Among the survivors versus non-survivors of @DISEASE$, there were significant differences in total leukocyte count (p&lt;0.001), neutrophil count, (p&lt;0.001), lymphocyte count (p&lt;0.001), urea (p&lt;0.001), serum bicarbonate (p=0.001), @GENE$ levels (p&lt;0.001), LDH (p=0.013), and D-dimer (p&lt;0.001) at admission.	1
In patients with @DISEASE$, admission @GENE$ correlated with disease severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse outcome.	1
The main laboratory findings were @DISEASE$ (33%) and elevated D-dimer (52%) and @GENE$ (40%) levels.	1
The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated @GENE$ (68.6% [58.2-78.2]), @DISEASE$ count (57.4% [44.8-69.5]) and increased lactate dehydrogenase (51.6% [31.4-71.6]).	1
@DISEASE$ and neutrophil count are frequently predictive in diagnostic models, while comorbidities, sex, @GENE$, and creatinine are frequent prognostic factors.	1
The combination of @DISEASE$ and elevated hs-@GENE$ yielded a sensitivity of 67Â·9% and specificity of 78Â·2% (AUC=0Â·730).	1
Patients transferred in ICU were more likely to have @DISEASE$, decreased SpO2 and increased D-dimer, @GENE$ and creatinine levels.	1
The corresponding AUC of @GENE$ and SAA values for severity of @DISEASE$ were 0.804 and 0.818, respectively.	1
Multiple regression analysis indicated that serum T: LH ratio was negatively associated with white blood cell counts and @GENE$ levels in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
Few parameters, such Lymphocytes count, SaO2 and @GENE$ serum level can be used to assess the severity of @DISEASE$ in emergency room.	1
In this multicenter retrospective cohort study we included adult patients with @DISEASE$, need of respiratory support, and elevated @GENE$ who received intravenous tocilizumab in addition to standard of care.	1
All had increased @GENE$ serum level and @DISEASE$.	1
Other common clinical features included hypoxia, chest crepitation, @DISEASE$ and high @GENE$.	1
Proteins associated with blood coagulation (D-dimer), cell damage (lactate dehydrogenase), and the inflammatory response (e.g., @GENE$) have already been identified as possible predictors of @DISEASE$ severity or mortality.	1
Herein, rationale is given for interpretation of @GENE$ blood levels as a simple, rapid, and cost-effective way to assess disease severity and help guide therapeutic options in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
@GENE$ values were also measured in patients with newly diagnosed @DISEASE$.	1
Laboratory studies showed hemoglobin (Hb) 5.1 g/dL, D-dimer 4.55 Âµg/mL, and @GENE$ 12.3 mg/dL. Computed tomography scan of the chest showed @DISEASE$ involving the bilateral lower lobe segmental branches.	1
Age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer and @GENE$ obtained on admission were identified as predictors of mortality for @DISEASE$ patients by LASSO.	1
The most common laboratory findings were elevated @GENE$ and @DISEASE$.	1
Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (@GENE$, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p &lt; 0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe @DISEASE$, non-White race, and mortality.	1
The survival curve analysis showed that higher @GENE$ (â¥5mg/L) plus any other abnormalities of lymphocyte, blood urea nitrogen or lactate dehydrogenase significantly predicted poor prognosis of @DISEASE$ infected elderly patients.	1
A total of 268 patients was evaluated; intermediate care units (IMCUs, 61%), sub-intensive care units (SICUs, 8%), intensive care units (ICUs, 17%) and rehabilitation units (RUs, 14%): BMI: &lt;18.5, 9% (higher in RUs, p = 0.008) and â¥30, 13% (higher in ICUs, p = 0.012); WL â¥ 5%, 52% (higher in ICUs and RUs, p = 0.001); @GENE$ &gt;0.5: 78% (higher in ICUs and lower in RUs, p &lt; 0.001); Nutritional risk and @DISEASE$ were present in 77% (higher in ICUs and RUs, p &lt; 0.001) and 50% (higher in ICUs, p = 0.0792) of the patients, respectively.	1
Among patients with negative initial chest radiographs, age â¥ 45 years (odds ratio [OR]: 3.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.76-8.75, p = 0.001), absolute lymphocyte count &lt; 1500 cells/Î¼L (OR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.03-4.89, p = 0.041), and @GENE$ &gt; 0.5 mg/dL (OR: 3.91, 95% CI: 1.54-9.91, p = 0.004) were independent predictors for future development of @DISEASE$.	1
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed NLR and @GENE$ were independent risk factors for severe @DISEASE$.	1
D-dimer and @GENE$ Blood Levels Over Time Used to Predict Pulmonary Embolism in Two @DISEASE$ Patients.	1
And although lymphocyte, D-dimer and @GENE$ levels did not demonstrate diagnostic value, all indicate severity of @DISEASE$.	1
Elevated level of @GENE$ may be an early marker to predict risk for severity of @DISEASE$.	1
@DISEASE$ related indicators such as WBC#, N#, L#, hs-@GENE$ showed no differences.	1
Patients with imaging progression were prone to be advanced in age [years: 60 (46-65) v 47 (37-60.75), P = 0.030]; @DISEASE$ (66.7% v 40.4%, P = 0.042) and low level of @GENE$ [mg/L: 5.7 (1.9-20.2) v 18.9 (6.7-38.9), P = 0.038].	1
@GENE$ correlates with computed tomographic findings and predicts severe @DISEASE$ early.	1
@GENE$ in severe @DISEASE$ patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.	1
Trends observed by serial laboratory measurements during hospitalization including progressive decrease of lymphocyte count, @DISEASE$, elevated @GENE$, procalcitonin, increased liver enzymes, decreased renal function, and coagulation derangements were more common in critically ill patient groups and associated with a high incidence of clinical complications.	1
@GENE$, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and ferritin in severe @DISEASE$: a meta-analysis.	1
Elevated @GENE$ was associated with an increased composite poor outcome [risk ratio (RR) 1.84 (1.45, 2.33), p &lt; 0.001; I2: 96%] and its severe @DISEASE$ (RR 1.41; I2: 93%) subgroup.	1
Subsequently, the @DISEASE$ improved without antipyretics and her @GENE$ level decreased rapidly.	1
A @DISEASE$ count and an increased high-sensitivity @GENE$ level were the most common laboratory findings.	1
None of them had @DISEASE$ after tocilizumab treatment and the levels of @GENE$ (13.08 Â± 12.89) were almost within normal limits.	1
@GENE$ Level May Predict the Risk of @DISEASE$ Aggravation.	1
The incidence of progression from severe to @DISEASE$, 28-day mortality, clinical symptom improvement, time to clinical symptom improvement, hematologic indicators including @GENE$, lymphocyte number, and interleukin 6, and imaging changes were observed and compared between the two groups.	1
Blood parameters showed @DISEASE$ in 345/418 (83%) of cases and a high @GENE$ in 587/626 (94%).	1
Correlation analysis showed that the @DISEASE$ index value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, @GENE$, procalcitonin, days from illness onset, and body temperature (P &lt; 0.05).	1
Among the 5 patients, 2 had @DISEASE$ (2/5, 40%), 1 had low absolute neutrophil counts (1/5, 20%), and 2 had increased high-sensitivity @GENE$ (2/5, 40%).	1
Many studies have reported the clinical characteristics of @DISEASE$: sudden deterioration of disease around 1-2 weeks after onset; much lower level of lymphocytes, especially natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood; extremely high pro-inflammatory cytokines and @GENE$ (CRP).	1
High @GENE$ and D-dimer levels were the parameters most frequently associated with severe @DISEASE$.	1
@GENE$ (HR, 1.164 per mg/dL; 95% CI, 1.006-1.347; p = 0.041) was independently associated with CEFS in the mild @DISEASE$ group (n = 54).	1
From 1 April 2020, patients with @DISEASE$-associated CSS, defined as rapid respiratory deterioration plus at least two out of three biomarkers with important elevations (@GENE$ &gt;100 mg/L; ferritin &gt;900 Âµg/L; D-dimer &gt;1500 Âµg/L), received high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 5 consecutive days (250 mg on day 1 followed by 80 mg on days 2-5).	1
Prognostic value of @GENE$ in patients with @DISEASE$.	1
@GENE$ was also an independent discriminator of severe/@DISEASE$ on admission (AUC 0.783, z=10.69, p&lt;0.001).	1
Higher biological markers of inflammation (@GENE$: 28 Â± 39 vs. 98 Â± 97 mg/L, p = .04), of fibrinolysis (D-dimer: 804 Â± 1,500 vs. 3,128 Â± 2,458 Î¼g/L, p = .02), and antiphospholipid antibodies in four cases were observed in the @DISEASE$ group.	1
Lymphocyte-to-@GENE$ Ratio: A Novel Predictor of Adverse Outcomes in @DISEASE$.	1
Patients with TCZ (n=20) had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (5.3 [Â±2.4] vs 3.4 [Â±2.6], P=0.014), presented with more severe forms (higher level of oxygen therapy at 13L/min vs 6L/min, P&lt;0.001), and had poorer biological findings (severe @DISEASE$: 676/mm3 vs 914/mm3, P=0.037 and higher @GENE$ level: 158mg/L vs 105mg/L, P=0.017) than patients without TCZ (n=25).	1
In univariate analyses, we also found that patients who died from @DISEASE$ had higher hyperinflammation markers than patients who survived: @GENE$ (181 (IQR 120-220) vs 107.4 (IQR 30-150; p 0.05); lactate dehydrogenase (641.8 (IQR 465.75-853.5) vs 361 (IQR 250-450), p 0.03); serum ferritin (1026 (IQR 228.3-1536.3) vs 861.3 (IQR 389-1490.5), p 0.04); D-dimer (12,019.8 (IQR 843.5-25,790.5) vs 1544.3 (IQR 619-1622), p 0.04).	1
@DISEASE$ (median, 0.77 x 103 per mm3; IQR, 0.58-1.00 x 103 per mm3), hyperinflammation with @GENE$ (median, 184.5 mg/dL; IQR, 108.2-269.1 mg/dL) and pro-coagulant status with D-dimer (median, 10.1 Î¼g/m; IQR, 5.0-23.8 Î¼g/m) were present.	1
Increased @GENE$ level, @DISEASE$ count, and increased D-dimer level were the most common laboratory findings.	1
LDH and @GENE$ may be related to respiratory function (PaO2/FiO2) and be a predictor of @DISEASE$ in CoVID-19 patients.	1
We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of @DISEASE$ and @GENE$.	1
@DISEASE$ and @GENE$ on arrival may predict poor outcomes.	1
The effect of anakinra was rapid, as judged by significant decrease of @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ at day 3.	1
@GENE$ is a useful marker to monitor @DISEASE$ in SOT.	1
This study revealed that the risk factors for the death in these elderly patients included comorbidities, increased levels of @GENE$ and blood urea nitrogen, and @DISEASE$ during hospitalization.	1
The risk factors of neutrophil count, hypersensitivity @GENE$, creatine kinase, and blood urea nitrogen could help clinicians to early identify @DISEASE$ severe patients with poor outcomes on admission.	1
Elevated levels of @GENE$ was found in all of them and the majority of them had evidence of @DISEASE$; intensive care admissions were needed in 12 (63%) and vasoactive medications were given to 6 (31.5%) children.	1
@GENE$ may help to identify patients with @DISEASE$ who are at greater risk of dying during hospitalization.	1
Moreover, the levels of @GENE$ (153.6 (80.3, 240.7) ng/L vs. 49.8 (15.9, 101.9) ng/L) and N-terminal @DISEASE$-type natriuretic peptide (852.0 (400.0, 2 315.3) ng/L vs. 197.0 (115.3, 631.0) ng/L) were significantly higher than patients without myocardial injury (all P&lt;0.01).	1
@DISEASE$ and marked elevation of the @GENE$ observed in four (13.3%) and 12 (40%) cases, respectively.	1
There were 14 patients (87.5%) with normal or decreased white blood cell count, 11 patients (68.75%) with @DISEASE$ count, 15 patients (93.75%) with increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 13 patients (81.25%) with increased hypersensitivity @GENE$, 5 patients (31.25%) with increased procalcitonin, and 8 patients (50%) with increased serum ferritin in peripheral blood, and stool routine was basically normal.	1
The laboratory and radiological characteristics of two groups mainly were @DISEASE$, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased @GENE$, increased lactate dehydrogenase, decreased oxygenation index, normal white blood cell count and bilateral chest CT involvement.	1
Early detection of elevations in serum @GENE$, combined with a clinical @DISEASE$ symptom presentation may be used as a surrogate marker for the presence and severity of the disease.	1
An increase in D-dimer blood levels and a decrease in @GENE$ blood levels over time may be used as a novel method to predict pulmonary embolism in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
Frequent laboratory findings were: elevated @GENE$ and @DISEASE$.	1
And although lymphocyte, D-dimer and @GENE$ levels did not demonstrate diagnostic value, all indicate severity of @DISEASE$.	1
Normal leukocyte counts (69.7%), @DISEASE$ (56.5%), elevated @GENE$ levels (73.6%), elevated ESR (65.6%), and oxygenation index decreased (63.6%) were observed in most patients.	1
Serum @GENE$ levels increase with increasing frequency of FQRS in patients with @DISEASE$ indicating that patients with FQRS are exposed to more inflammation.	1
The leukocyte, lymphocyte, and thrombocyte count and @GENE$ levels were lowest in the @DISEASE$ group (p&lt;0.001, p=0.04, p&lt;0.001, p=0.007 respectively).	1
In addition, @DISEASE$ patients showed higher mean platelet volume, lower @GENE$ concentrations, and higher De Ritis ratio.	1
The improvement of LYM and @GENE$ may be associated with the prognoses of @DISEASE$.	1
The two cases with severe illness had profound @DISEASE$ with markedly elevated @GENE$, procalcitonin, and ferritin.	1
Therefore, it is imperative to closely monitor laboratory parameters including the WBC count, LYMPH count, and @GENE$, along with other imaging features in chest CT scans, to promptly prevent, diagnose, and treat a @DISEASE$ during pregnancy.	1
Patients with @DISEASE$ had higher peak inflammatory markers like @GENE$ 184 (111-258) versus 142 (65-229) p = 0.012 and peak LDH 560 (384-758) versus 499 (324-655) p = 0.017.	1
Patients exhibited @DISEASE$ and elevated inflammatory markers, including @GENE$ and ferritin.	1
The @GENE$, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of @DISEASE$ assessed on initial CT (Rrange, 0.36-0.75; P &lt; 0.05).	1
This meta-analysis showed that an elevated serum @GENE$, PCT, D-dimer, and ferritin were associated with a poor outcome in @DISEASE$.	1
The CXR score showed a significant positive correlation with @GENE$, lactate dehydrogenase, and @DISEASE$ duration, and a negative correlation with oxygen saturation.	1
Signature score differences in laboratory and CT imaging features between subgroups were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05); @DISEASE$ was negatively correlated with GLCM Entropy_angle 90_offset4 (r=-0.578), but was positively correlated with ShortRunEmphhasis_AllDirect_offset4_SD (r=0.454); @GENE$ was positively correlated with Cluster Prominence_ AllDirect_offset 4_ SD (r=0.47).	1
The proportion of ground glass opacity (GGO), @DISEASE$ and the total lesion based on the quantitative method was positively correlated with the semi-quantitative CT score (P &lt; 0.001 for all; rs = 0.88, 0.87, 0.90), @GENE$ (P = 0.0278, 0.0168, 0.0078; rs = 0.40, 0.43, 0.48) and ESR (P = 0.0296, 0.0408, 0.0048; rs = 0.46, 0.44, 0.58), respectively, and was negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count (P = 0.0222, 0.0024, 0.0068; rs = -0.42, -0.53, -0.48).	1
Our results demonstrated that the nomogram and Combined Index calculated from the NLR and @GENE$ are potential and reliable predictors of @DISEASE$ prognosis and can triage patients at the time of admission.	1
In addition, they were more likely to have increased inflammatory response and @DISEASE$ as reflected in @GENE$ (51.1 (1.3-127.9) vs 12.1 (0.1-212.0) mg/L, p&lt;0.05) and D-dimer (6.9 (0.3-20.0) vs 0.5 (0.1-20.0) mg/L, p&lt;0.001).	1
Admission to the PICU was significantly associated with higher @GENE$, procalcitonin, and @DISEASE$ type natriuretic peptide levels and platelet counts (P &lt; .05 for all).	1
Owing to 44-60% @DISEASE$ presentation, risk of the high inflammatory state, and coagulation cascade abnormalities reported in ECoVs, testing for @GENE$, serum creatine kinase, and D-dimer level is mandatory.	1
The @DISEASE$ (0.37 Ã 109/L [interquartile range: 0.23-0.65]) and increased @GENE$ (24.7 Ã 109/L [interquartile range: 13.57-38]) were observed.	1
In this multicenter retrospective study, routine laboratory parameters (@GENE$, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts), demographic data and the chest X-ray/CT result from 967 patients entering the ED with @DISEASE$ were collected.	1
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) peak values were correlated with risk of death (OR 1.007 [95% CI 1.002-1.01], P = 0.005) along with age, multiple comorbidities, @DISEASE$ , ICU admission and @GENE$.	1
Common laboratory features included @DISEASE$ [6/7 (86%)], elevated lactate dehydrogenase [3/4 (75%)], D-dimer [5/6 (83%)], high-sensitivity @GENE$ [4/4 (100%)] and procalcitonin [5/5 (100%)].	1
Seventeen factors were independently associated with an increased hazard of death, the strongest among them included advanced age, @DISEASE$, low age-adjusted oxygen saturation, higher concentrations of @GENE$, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate.	1
@DISEASE$ women had a higher BMI (p &lt; 0.001), systolic (p &lt; 0.0001) and diastolic (p &lt; 0.05) blood pressure, waist circumference (p &lt; 0.0001), testosterone (p &lt; 0.0001), free androgen index (p &lt; 0.0001) and @GENE$ (p &lt; 0.0001).	1
@DISEASE$ (59%) with elevated @GENE$ (70%) was observed and 91% of the women were delivered by cesarean section.	1
On multivariable analysis, age (per-year increase OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.10; p &lt; 0.001), @DISEASE$ (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.07-6.25; p 0.03), and @GENE$ levels (per-point increase OR 1.009; 95% CI 1.004-1.014; p 0.001) were independent risk factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality.	1
Marked elevation of cytokines/chemokines is observed with elevation of additional markers of inflammation, coagulation, and organ damage such as @GENE$, D-dimer, LDH, Ferritin and Troponin-I. This hyperinflammation leads to worsening of oxygen saturation due to pulmonary infiltration and exudation, organ damage, and dysfunction of coagulation pathway and may lead to multi-@DISEASE$.	1
Before regular treatments, the sum score of the opacities showed @DISEASE$ to moderate correlations with duration, @GENE$, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase levels (R ranged from 0.341-0.651, P &lt; .05).	1
Several laboratory markers (lower O2 saturation and platelets, and higher leukocytes, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, @GENE$, procalcitonin, and ferritin) were associated with @DISEASE$ severity.	1
Higher levels of @DISEASE$ indices (e.g. white blood cell count, neutrophil count, @GENE$ and procalcitonin) were observed in the elevated group.	1
There was a significant positive correlation between Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QTc ratio and @GENE$ in patients with newly diagnosed @DISEASE$ (rs = 0.332, p = .005, rs = 0.397, p &lt; .001 consecutively).	1
CONCLUSIONS Old age (&gt;70 years old), @GENE$ &gt;100 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase &gt;300 U/L, and lactic acid &gt;3 mmol/L are high-risk factors related to myocardial damage in critical patients with @DISEASE$.	1
Compared with the first hospitalization, there were significant decreases in @DISEASE$ (5 vs 0, P = .035), elevated levels of both white blood cell count (P = .036) and lymphocyte count (P = .002), remarkedly decreases in @GENE$ and serum amyloid A (P &lt; .05) in the second hospitalization.	1
Higher levels of NLR and @GENE$ at admission were associated with poor prognosis of individuals with moderate @DISEASE$.	1
ROC curve analysis revealed that the AUC of age, @GENE$ and lymphocyte count for @DISEASE$ were 0.873, 0.911 and 0.817, respectively.	1
Laboratory findings are nonspecific; @DISEASE$, elevation of @GENE$ and procalcitonin have been described.	1
We suggest that higher, possibly therapeutic levels of anticoagulation might be mandatory for a further subset of patients with @DISEASE$ where a discrepant evolution of @GENE$ and D-dimer is observed.	1
A meta-analysis of seven studies with 1905 patients showed that increased @GENE$ (OR 3.0, 95% CI: 2.1-4.4), @DISEASE$ (OR 4.5, 95% CI: 3.3-6.0), and increased LDH (OR 6.7, 95% CI: 2.4-18.9) were significantly associated with severity.	1
The assessment of serum biochemical and blood hematological factors showed that there was a strong correlation between @DISEASE$ intensity and high serum Cr, BUN, and ALT levels, high @GENE$ concentration, and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts in male KTRs.	1
Data were collected on age, sex, physical ability, rehabilitation modality (remote/direct), need for intubation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, degree of @DISEASE$, oxygen therapy from the start of rehabilitation, D-dimer and @GENE$ levels, and rehabilitation-related complications.	1
The elderly and patients with higher level of @GENE$ were more likely to experience a severe outcome of @DISEASE$.	1
@GENE$ levels in the early stage of @DISEASE$.	1
Among all univariable parameters, lymphocytes, @GENE$, and LDH were significantly independent risk factors of @DISEASE$ severity.	1
To investigate the value of the combined detection of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and @GENE$ level (CRP) in the diagnosis of @DISEASE$.	1
Importantly, @GENE$, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe @DISEASE$.	1
Laboratory findings included elevated @GENE$ (57%) and @DISEASE$ (50%).	1
Visceral fat (VAT) was significantly higher in patients requiring intensive care (p = 0.032), together with age (p = 0.009), inflammation markers @GENE$ and LDH (p &lt; 0.0001, p = 0.003, respectively), and @DISEASE$ severity as assessed by a Lung Severity Score (LSS) (p &lt; 0.0001).	1
Patients without @DISEASE$ still exhibited mild illness and had elevated SAA levels but not @GENE$ levels.	1
For patients with elevated levels of both SAA and @GENE$, and a high NLR, a @DISEASE$ was predicted, requiring medical attention.	1
Therefore, @GENE$ and SAA levels demonstrate a prognostic value for predicting the severity of @DISEASE$.	1
Most of the liver function indexes in @DISEASE$ patients were correlated with @GENE$ and NLR, the markers of inflammation.	1
1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), @GENE$ level &gt;200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level &gt;2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with @DISEASE$ than age or comorbidities.	1
The following parameters were comparable including lymphocyte counts, @GENE$, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, bilateral involvement in chest CT (76.9% vs. 71.9%), worsening of @DISEASE$ (15.4% vs. 9.4%), favorable outcome (92.3% vs. 96.9%) between ACEI/ARB group and non-ACEI/ARB group respectively (all P&gt;0.05).	1
During the prenatal and postpartum period, there was no difference in the count of WBC, Neutrophils and Lymphocyte, the radio of Neutrophils and Lymphocyte and the level of @GENE$ between the confirmed @DISEASE$ group and the control group(p&lt;0.05).	1
@GENE$ and D-dimer levels positively correlated with severe @DISEASE$ and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio decreased as the patients improved clinically.	1
Moreover, the smooth curve fitting graph reflected that the severity of @DISEASE$ was positively correlated with both age and @GENE$ levels (all P value &lt; 0.05).	1
@DISEASE$ were positively related to @GENE$ levels but negatively related to sleep quality.	1
In the multivariate regression, @DISEASE$ (odds ratio [OR], 8.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.81-44.42; P = 0.007), CT score &gt; 5 (OR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.44-9.53; P = 0.007), old age (&gt; 77 years, OR, 9.96; 95% CI, 3.78-26.28; P &lt; 0.001), and elevated @GENE$ (OR, 4.15; 95% CI, 1.62-10.6; P = 0.003) were significant prognostic factors of severe disease.	1
The prognostic value of admission @GENE$ was evaluated in patients with @DISEASE$.	1
Receiver operating characteristic analysis concluded LDH (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.875), D-dimer (AUC: 0.803), and PCT (AUC: 0.769) were superior biomarkers to ferritin (AUC: 0.714) and @GENE$ (AUC: 0.711) in predicting the fatality of @DISEASE$.	1
Logistic regression indicated that SAA and @GENE$ were independent risk factors for the severity of @DISEASE$.	1
24 patients (18 symptomatic, 6 asymptomatic) with confirmed @DISEASE$ by polymerase chain reaction underwent bedside ChUS in addition to @GENE$ following admission.	1

Rapid blood tests, including platelet count, @GENE$ time, D-dimer, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio can help clinicians to assess severity and prognosis of patients with @DISEASE$.	1
The D-dimer is frequently elevated in @DISEASE$, but other markers of coagulation activation, including the @GENE$ fragment 1.2 (PF1.2) are poorly described.	1
In patients with elevated @GENE$ time, @DISEASE$/anti-cardiolipin antibody-positivity should be suspected, and anticoagulation prophylaxis should be continued perioperatively for better outcomes.	1
Multivariate logistic regression showed that an age over 60 years (OR=8.165, 95% CI: 1.483-45.576, P=0.017), prolonged @GENE$ time (OR=7.516, 95% CI: 2.568-21.998, P=0.006) and elevated NT-proBNP (OR=6.194, 95% CI: 1.305-29.404, P=0.022) were independent risk factors for critical type of @DISEASE$.	1

A total of 118 patients (49 males and 69 females) were included in this study; the results revealed that the following factors associated with in-hospital mortality: older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.175, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.073-1.287, P = .001), neutrophil count greater than 6.3 Ã 10 cells/L (OR 7.174, (95% CI 2.295-22.432, P = .001), @DISEASE$ (OR 0.069, 95% CI 0.007-0.722, P = .026), @GENE$ time &gt;13 seconds (OR 11.869, 95% CI 1.433-98.278, P = .022), D-dimer &gt;1 mg/L (OR 22.811, 95% CI 2.224-233.910, P = .008) and procalcitonin (PCT) &gt;0.1 ng/mL (OR 23.022, 95% CI 3.108-170.532, P = .002).	1
An age over 60 years, a prolonged @GENE$ time and elevated NT-proBNP level are important clinical features of critically ill patients with @DISEASE$, and can be deemed as early warning signals for critical conditions of the disease.	1
D-Dimer and @GENE$ Time Are the Significant Indicators of Severe @DISEASE$ and Poor Prognosis.	1

@GENE$ may be a critical mediator associated with the development of thrombotic phenomena in @DISEASE$, and should be a target for future study.	1
Platelet activation and platelet-monocyte aggregates formation trigger @GENE$ expression in severe @DISEASE$ patients.	1
@DISEASE$ replicates in TF-bearing epithelial and endothelial cells and may stimulate and integrate host cell @GENE$, like HSV1 and other known coagulopathic viruses.	1
Additionally, the generation of antiphospholipid antibodies associated with @DISEASE$ may also promote an increase in @GENE$.	1
Meanwhile, the patients displayed dramatically elevated levels of serum inflammatory factors, while a markedly prolonged activated partial @GENE$ time (APTT) in critically ill patients reflected @DISEASE$.	1
@GENE$ also functions from within the nascent TF/FVIIa/FXa complex to trigger profound changes via protease-activated receptors (PARs) in many cell types, including @DISEASE$-trophic cells.	1
Therefore, aberrant expression of @GENE$ may be the underlying basis of @DISEASE$ symptoms.	1
Strikingly, envelope @GENE$ is essential for HSV1 @DISEASE$ in mice, and the FXa-directed oral anticoagulant apixaban had remarkable antiviral efficacy.	1
Bowles et al. have found that @DISEASE$ were positive in 91% of patients (n=34) with high activated partial @GENE$ time (aPTT).	1

LV-@GENE$ and RV-LS are independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with @DISEASE$.	1
A diagnostic genomic signal processing (@GENE$)-based system for automatic feature analysis and detection of @DISEASE$.	1
The aim of this randomised @GENE$-controlled trial is to clarify whether combination therapy with the antibiotic azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine via anti-inflammation/immune modulation, antiviral efficacy and pre-emptive treatment of supra-infections can shorten hospitalisation duration for patients with @DISEASE$ (measured as   days alive and out of hospital   as the primary outcome), reduce the risk of non- invasive ventilation, treatment in the intensive care unit and death.	1
We aim to assess if elevations in @GENE$/ALT were associated with poor outcomes in hospitalized @DISEASE$ patients.	1
An updated meta-analysis of @GENE$ and ALT levels and the mortality of @DISEASE$ patients.	1
The changes in peripheral blood cells were mainly lymphonpenia (83 cases, 55%) and @DISEASE$ (95 cases, 63%), The lymphocyte count of the severe and critically ill patients was more significantly reduced, and some patients had increased myocardial enzymes, mainly LDH (47 cases, 31%), and a few patients had liver function damage, mainly manifested in ALT and @GENE$.	1
Conclusion: @GENE$-dominant aminotransferase elevation is common in @DISEASE$, mirrors disease severity, and appears to reflect true hepatic injury.	1
Age [ OR 5.73 (95% CI, 1.14-28.81)], @DISEASE$ [OR 5.50 (95%CI, 1.02-29.64)], @GENE$ [OR 6.57 (95%CI, 1.33-32.48)]and BUN [5.59 (95%CI, 1.05-29.74)] at admission were considered to predict the risk of death in critical patients and were selected to construct the nomogram.	1
Rising bilirubin and @GENE$/ALT ratio predicted mortality among @DISEASE$ patients.	1
Serum ALT (WMD: 7.19 [4.90, 9.48]; p &lt; 0.001; I2 = 69%), @GENE$ (WMD: 9.02 [6.89, 11.15]; p &lt; 0.001; I2 = 73%) and bilirubin levels (WMD: 1.78 [0.86, 2.70]; p &lt; 0.001; I2 = 82%) were significantly higher in patients with severe @DISEASE$ when compared to patients with non-severe disease.	1
The levels of ALT, @GENE$, TBIL, LDH and INR showed statistically significant elevation in severe @DISEASE$ cases compared with that in mild cases.	1
ALT/@GENE$ elevation was common and independently associated with adverse clinical outcomes in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
Correlation between Heart @GENE$ and severe @DISEASE$: A case-control study.	1
Class A @GENE$ Antagonist Famotidine as a Therapeutic Alternative Against @DISEASE$:	1
Famotidine, a class A @GENE$ antagonist used for the treatment of @DISEASE$ was recently identified in an in silico screening.	1
AST highly correlated with @GENE$ throughout the illness course (r = 0.97; P &lt; 0.0001), whereas correlations with markers of muscle injury and inflammation were @DISEASE$.	1
Of 105 @DISEASE$ and chronic HBV co-infected patients, elevated levels of liver test were seen in several patients at admission, including elevated levels of @GENE$ (22, 20.95%), aspartate aminotransferase (29, 27.62%), total bilirubin (7, 6.67%), gamma-glutamyl transferase (7, 6.67%), and alkaline phosphatase (1, 0.95%).	1
The SMD of @DISEASE$, GGT, @GENE$, and AST elevation in severe as compared to non-severe were - 1.05 (- 1.27 to - 0.83), 0.76 (0.40-1.12), 0.42 (0.27-0.56), and 0.69 (0.52-0.86), respectively.	1
Overweight/@DISEASE$ was determined as body mass index (BMI) â¥24 kg/m2, ALF was determined as @GENE$ &gt;40 U/L, and prolonged hospitalization was lasting more than the median value of the hospitalized days (19 days) in this population.	1
In our meta-analysis of 19 studies, which included a total of 4,103 patients, the pooled mean @GENE$ and aspartate aminotransferase levels were respectively 31.7 and 51.0 IU/L in the patients with @DISEASE$ who died and 27.7 and 32.9 IU/L in those discharged alive (both p &lt; 0.0001).	1
The pooled WMD of AST and @GENE$ in severe vs. mild @DISEASE$ were 12.23 (95% CI; 8.07, 16.39; p &lt; 0.01) and 8.07 (95% CI 2.55, 11.91; p &lt; 0.01), respectively.	1
When compared between severe and non-severe @DISEASE$ patients, the pooled ORs of elevated @GENE$, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were 2.35 (95% CI 1.38-3.98), 3.21 (95% CI 2.59-3.98), 1.87 (95% CI 1.32-2.65), and 4.83 (95% CI 2.90-8.05), respectively.	1
Remdesivir was interrupted before the initialy planned duration in four patients, two because of @GENE$ elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of @DISEASE$ requiring renal replacement.	1
Emerging data on LFTs in @DISEASE$ are heterogeneous indicating mild LFTs involvement in every fourth to fifth patients with numerical more prevalent AST over @GENE$ elevations.	1
A role for selenium-dependent @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ virulence.	1
From the results, it has been found that the proposed @GENE$-based models use simple linkage functions and are highly reliable for time series prediction of @DISEASE$ cases in India.	1
@GENE$-0920, an Indole Chloropyridinyl Ester, Completely Blocks @DISEASE$.	1
While @GENE$-0820 and the nucleotide analog remdesivir blocked @DISEASE$, viral breakthrough occurred.	1
While @GENE$-0820 and remdesivir blocked @DISEASE$, viral breakthrough occurred as examined with immunocytochemistry.	1
In contrast, @GENE$-0920 completely blocked the infectivity and cytopathic effect of @DISEASE$ without significant toxicity.	1
In view of this, it is plausible that the mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effect of chloroquine against @DISEASE$ involves inhibition of host @GENE$.	1
Is @GENE$ a molecular target of chloroquine treatment against @DISEASE$?	1
A diagnostic genomic signal processing (@GENE$)-based system for automatic feature analysis and detection of @DISEASE$.	1
Therefore, we hypothesized that redox modulators like melatonin can protect neutrophil health and functions under @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ activity-deficient conditions.	1
We demonstrate the dual role of melatonin, wherein it protects neutrophils from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by reducing ROS generation; in contrast, it restores neutrophil functions like phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis in @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ activity-deficient neutrophils by regulating ROS levels both in vitro and in vivo.	1
Amplification of human @GENE$ for appraising the accuracy of negative @DISEASE$ RT-PCR results in upper respiratory tract specimens.	1
Newly-diagnosed @DISEASE$ was defined by @GENE$c and fasting glucose.	1
Multivariate modeling was used to assess the independent association of @GENE$c levels and outpatient @DISEASE$ treatment regimen with mortality, in addition to independent effects of demographic and clinical characteristics.	1
The extent to which clinical and demographic factors moderate this relationship is unclear, though signals are emerging that link higher BMI and higher @GENE$c to worse outcomes in PWD with @DISEASE$.	1
Additionally, a significantly elevated hemoglobin A1c (@GENE$c) signified undiagnosed @DISEASE$.	1
BNP level showed positive correlation with @GENE$c (r = 0.49, p = 0.04) and negative correlation with delta pO2 (r = -0.52, p = 0.04) can predict reduced microvascular compliance due to @DISEASE$ contributing to hypoxia susceptibility in healthy individuals.	1
Random plasma glucose at 12 weeks, and fasting plasma glucose or @GENE$c at 28 weeks identify women with @DISEASE$ at risk of suboptimal pregnancy outcomes.	1
This was a retrospective study of @DISEASE$ patients who underwent an @GENE$c test.	1
The population was composed by 63.2% female individuals, age median of 66 years, @DISEASE$ duration 10.7 Â± 8.2 years and @GENE$c 7.7 Â± 1.9% (61 + 20.8 mmol/mol).	1
@GENE$c is a biomarker with a central role in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with @DISEASE$, although not a perfect one.	1
We undertook a meta-analysis on the screening and diagnostic accuracy of the haemoglobin A1c (@GENE$c) test in women with and without risk factors for @DISEASE$.	1
Overall (n = 120), participants had a mean age of 54.8 Â± 14.4 years-old, and @GENE$c of 9.0 Â± 1.6% (75 Â± 17.5 mmol/mol); 93% of patients showed signs of current @DISEASE$ based on the surveys measured.	1
There is a growing body of evidence on the accuracy of @GENE$c as a screening and diagnostic test for @DISEASE$.	1
A higher @GENE$c was associated with referable @DISEASE$.	1
Among them, 51 were previously diagnosed with @DISEASE$ and 3 were newly diagnosed based on @GENE$c over 6.5%.	1
Is @GENE$c an ideal biomarker of well-controlled @DISEASE$?	1
A simulation model was created using glycemic data from previous disasters (taken as similar in impact to current lockdown) taking baseline @GENE$c and @DISEASE$ data from India-specific database.	1
@GENE$c is more useful as a specific test at a cut-off of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) with a false positive rate of 10%, but should be supplemented by a more sensitive test to detect women with @DISEASE$.	1
To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic performance of alternative diagnostic strategies to oral glucose tolerance tests, including random plasma glucose, fasting plasma glucose and @GENE$c , during the @DISEASE$.	1
The @DISEASE$ and the subsequent lockdown have not adversely affected metabolic control in our patients, and indeed there appears to be an improvement in @GENE$c levels.	1
@DISEASE$ results of a default in the @GENE$ synthesis.	1
@GENE$ impairs hemoglobin's ability to transport oxygen, produces functional @DISEASE$, and leads to tissue hypoxia.	1
Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), @GENE$, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU @DISEASE$ patients and 25 healthy individuals.	1
Many patients had white blood cell counts with abnormal neutrophil and lymphocyte numbers, @GENE$ concentration, coagulation profiles, and blood biochemistry, and increased @DISEASE$ markers.	1
In conclusion, NO, @GENE$ and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical @DISEASE$ disease.	1
Elevated Glucose Levels Favor @DISEASE$ and Monocyte Response through a @GENE$/Glycolysis-Dependent Axis.	1
Elevated Glucose Levels Favor @DISEASE$ and Monocyte Response through a @GENE$/Glycolysis-Dependent Axis.	1
This review addresses some of the pathways leading to endothelial derangement, such as complement, @GENE$, and @DISEASE$ tyrosine kinases.	1
@GENE$-induced changes in monocyte metabolism by @DISEASE$ directly inhibit T cell response and reduce epithelial cell survival.	1
These frequencies were higher than those found in uninfected @GENE$*02:01+ donors (â¼2.5 Ã 10-6), but low when compared to frequencies for @DISEASE$-specific (A2/M158) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific (A2/BMLF1280) (â¼1.38 Ã 10-4) populations.	1
When alleles were examined simultaneously using a multiple regression model to control for confounding factors, @GENE$*44 and C*01 were still positively and independently associated with @DISEASE$: a growth rate of 16% (95%CI: 0.1-35%) per 1% point increase in B*44 prevalence; and of 19% (95%CI: 1-41%) per 1% point increase in C*01 prevalence.	1
@GENE$ multifunctionality is commonly associated with the presence of flexible or disordered regions, we analyze here the intrinsic disorder predisposition of major players related to the @DISEASE$ - RAAS axis.	1
Conversely, we found that @GENE$*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved @DISEASE$ peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting that it could enable cross-protective T-cell-based immunity.	1
We also looked at which immune dominant regions of @DISEASE$ and other coronaviruses are recognized by Major Histocompatibility Complex (@GENE$)/Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) genes and how this could impact on subsequent disease pathogenesis.	1
Our epidemiologic analysis, despite the limits of the ecological approach, is strongly suggestive of a permissive role of @GENE$*01 and B*44 towards @DISEASE$, which warrants further investigation in case-control studies.	1
These viral antigens can be either recognized by the B cells or presented by @GENE$ complexes to the T cells, resulting in antibody production, increased cytokine secretion, and cytolytic activity in the acute phase of @DISEASE$.	1
The association of @GENE$ alleles and its downregulated expression has been correlated with disease severity against @DISEASE$ and coronaviruses.	1
Since @DISEASE$ restrains antigen presentation by downregulating @GENE$ class I and II molecules and, therefore, inhibits the T cell-mediated immune responses, humoral immune responses also play a substantial role.	1
In the context of specific immune response against the virus, a correlation between Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I (@GENE$-I) and the severity of the disease in patients with @DISEASE$ has been suggested.	1
Being aware of the intrinsic limitations of in silico analysis (mainly the differences between the real and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure; and accuracy of the methods for simulate proteasome cleavage), we identified 24 epitopes able to interact with 17 @GENE$-I more frequent alleles in the Brazilian population that could be useful for the development of strategic methods for vaccines against @DISEASE$.	1
Taking the data deposited in the GISAID database, we made predictions using the IEDB analysis resource (TepiTool) to gauge how variants in the @DISEASE$ genome may change peptide binding to the most frequent @GENE$-class I and -II alleles in Africa, Asia and Europe.	1
@GENE$ 4-digit typing along with viral sequence analysis should be considered in studies examining clinical outcomes in patients with @DISEASE$.	1
The present study shows, by in silico analysis, that these common human viruses are expected to induce immune memory against @DISEASE$ by sharing protein fragments (antigen epitopes) for presentation to the immune system by @GENE$ class I. A list of such epitopes is provided.	1
We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, and Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of @DISEASE$ based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and @GENE$/paratope binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects.	1
Computationally Optimized @DISEASE$ @GENE$ Class I and II Vaccine Formulations Predicted to Target Human Haplotype Distributions.	1
@GENE$: A Possible Crucial Therapeutic Target for @DISEASE$?	1
It is conceivable that extracellular @DISEASE$ RNA may reach the cellular cytosol via @GENE$-assisted transfer combined with lysosome leakage.	1
They have been shown to act against the priming of @DISEASE$ attachment proteins by host and viral enzymes, and the release of @GENE$ by host immune cells.	1
Based on these observations we propose extracellular @GENE$ to be considered as a therapeutic target for @DISEASE$.	1
The increase in @GENE$ and NETosis could lead to sustained inflammation due to @DISEASE$.	1
As competitive inhibitors of @GENE$, the key enzyme of the   mevalonate pathway   through which essential compounds, not only cholesterol, are synthesized, statins decrease the levels of cholesterol, and thus LDLs, as an innate defense mechanism, with controversial results in decreasing mortality from @DISEASE$.	1
There is a potential role for @GENE$ upregulation to treat/prevent @DISEASE$.	1
The @DISEASE$ open reading frame 3 a (ORF3a) protein was found to bind to the human @GENE$ at a high confidence through high-throughput screening experiments.	1
The role of carbon monoxide and @GENE$ in @DISEASE$.	1
We propose that subjects with @DISEASE$, old age, and male gender have the greatest morbidity and mortality and have low stress proteins, in particular, low intracellular heme oxygenase (@GENE$), making them particularly vulnerable to the disease.	1
The @GENE$ pathway can inhibit platelet aggregation, and can have anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties, amongst others, all of which are critical medical conditions observed in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
We therefore postulate that free heme contributes to many of the inflammatory phenomena witnessed in critically ill @DISEASE$ patients, whilst induction of @GENE$ or harnessing heme may provide protection.	1
Additionally, @DISEASE$'s heme reduction may contribute to even lower @GENE$.	1
Controlled trials of these @GENE$ inducers should be done in order to prevent or treat @DISEASE$ disease.	1
Intestinal receptor of @DISEASE$ in inflamed IBD tissue seems downregulated by @GENE$ in ileum and upregulated by interferon regulating factors in colon.	1

The current outbreak of @DISEASE$ was estimated to have originated on 12/11/2019 (95% @GENE$ 11/13/2019-12/23/2019).	1
Equally, it is important that expert advice from intestinal failure teams is available when home parenteral nutrition (@GENE$)-dependent patients require admission with @DISEASE$.	1

The present study indicates that changes toward a higher number of HRBs than before confinement, as well as the prevalence of each @GENE$ except screen exposure, decreased during the first 3 weeks of @DISEASE$ confinement, and thus the Spanish adult population may have adapted to the new situational context by gradually improving their health behaviors.	1
Among 4,689 @GENE$-seasons, we detected @DISEASE$ in 387 (8%).	1
We suggest that further work should be urgently carried out to confirm if @GENE$ is indeed a good molecular target and if some of those drugs have potential to be repurposed for @DISEASE$ antiviral activity.	1
Recently, surface @GENE$ has been reported to be a potential receptor of some viruses, including the novel @DISEASE$.	1
Preliminary Virtual Screening Studies to Identify @GENE$ Inhibitors Which May Interfere with @DISEASE$.	1
A possible role for @GENE$ in cross vaccination against @DISEASE$.	1
Serum @GENE$ level median value was statistically significantly higher in @DISEASE$-positive group compared to the other groups (p=0.0003).	1
Surface @GENE$ has been proposed to have various roles, such as receptor-mediated signal transduction, a co-receptor for soluble ligands, as well as a participant in @DISEASE$ survival, proliferation, and resistance.	1
In addition, we aimed to identify drugs that could be repurposed to inhibit @GENE$, thus with potential anti-@DISEASE$ activity.	1
The stress-inducible molecular chaperone @GENE$ as potential therapeutic target for @DISEASE$.	1
In this regard, pharmacological inhibition of @GENE$ could attract attention to potentially ameliorate inappropriate inflammatory reaction in severe @DISEASE$ patients.	1
A dermatopathological biopsy suggested a bullous drug reaction with an @DISEASE$-like reaction pattern versus @GENE$/TEN.	1
These findings differed from those for @GENE$, where gene expression was increased in @DISEASE$ and less consistent differences were observed related to sex, race, and use of ICS.	1
Using confirmatory factor analysis, the factor structure of the IES-@DISEASE$ was found to be similar to the original IES, indicating two latent factors: intrusion and avoidance, Ï2 (85) = 147.51, @GENE$ = .92, TLI = .90, RMSEA = .044, SRMR = .049.	1
The results support a bifactor model consisting of one general factor and two specific factors-one of emotional fear reactions and another of somatic expressions of fear of @DISEASE$ (@GENE$ = 0.988, RMSEA = 0.075).	1
Given the significance of TLSs in mucosal immunity, their association with positive prognosis and response to immune checkpoint blockade with a critical role of Type I interferon (@GENE$) in inducing these, we also discuss potentiating TLS formation as a promising approach to enhance anti-@DISEASE$.	1
We propose that lessons learned from BCG immunotherapy success could be applied to not only augment such microbe-based therapeutics but also lead to similar adjunctive @GENE$ activating approaches to improve response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in @DISEASE$.	1
Here, we investigated properties of type I (Î²), II (Î³), and III (Î»1) interferons (IFNs), potent immune cytokines that are normally produced during @DISEASE$ and that upregulate @GENE$-stimulated gene (ISG) effectors to limit virus replication.	1
Type I @GENE$ deficiency: an immunological characteristic of severe @DISEASE$ patients.	1
Based on this, we propose that the type I @GENE$ response plays a pivotal role in exacerbating inflammation in severe @DISEASE$.	1
Herein, we report the sensitivity of @DISEASE$ to recombinant human interferons Î± and Î² (@GENE$/Î²).	1
A suppression of the @GENE$-I response has been noted in @DISEASE$.	1
However, coronaviruses similar to @DISEASE$ can suppress host @GENE$-I antiviral responses.	1
@GENE$-induced protein p53 directly reduces epithelial proliferation and differentiation, which increases disease severity and susceptibility to bacterial @DISEASE$.	1
Thus, excessive or prolonged @GENE$ production aggravates @DISEASE$ by impairing lung epithelial regeneration.	1
Although there are ongoing clinical trials to test the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis, there has not been any proposal to test the efficacy of @GENE$ Î±-2b together with hydroxychloroquine to increase protection against @DISEASE$.	1

Here, we observed the distribution of MERS-CoV receptors using human respiratory mucosa and also evaluated the contribution of interferon-lambdas (@GENE$-Î»s) in response to MERS-CoV @DISEASE$ using in vitro normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) and bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells.	1
Various interferon (@GENE$)-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins for @DISEASE$, is there a role for the combination of mycophenolic acid and interferon?	1
In contrast, @DISEASE$-1 was restricted only by @GENE$ in these cell lines.	1
An unbalanced immune response, characterized by a @DISEASE$ production of type I interferons (@GENE$-Is) and an exacerbated release of proinflammatory cytokines, contributes to the severe forms of the disease.	1
Here, we describe our current knowledge of the complex interplay between @DISEASE$ and the @GENE$ system, highlighting some of the gaps that need to be filled for a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms.	1
@DISEASE$ can effectively suppress the anti-viral @GENE$ response in monocytes and macrophages.	1
We discuss the unique role of IFNÎ» in fine-tuning antiviral immunity in the respiratory tract to achieve optimal protection and minimal host damage and review early evidence that @DISEASE$ may impair IFNÎ» induction, leading to a delayed type I @GENE$-dominated response that triggers hyperinflammation and severe disease.	1

Type 1 interferons (@GENE$-I) are a family cytokines of the early innate immune response to viruses that are being tested against @DISEASE$.	1
The induction of IFNs was identified in NHNE and NHBE cells after MERS-CoV @DISEASE$ and @GENE$-Î»s were predominantly increased in MERS-CoV-infected respiratory epithelial cells.	1
We describe here the effects of treatment with interferon (@GENE$)-Î±2b in a cohort of confirmed @DISEASE$ cases in Wuhan, China.	1
In addition, the evidence suggests that @GENE$ type I and III can play an important role in controlling viremia and modulating the immune response in @DISEASE$.	1
Thus, @GENE$-Î» has a decisive function in the respiratory epithelium that greatly limits MERS-CoV replication, and may be a key cytokine for better therapeutic outcomes against MERS-CoV @DISEASE$ in respiratory tract.	1
PEDV @DISEASE$ does not elicit a robust @GENE$ response, and some of the mechanisms used by the virus to counteract the host innate immune response have been unraveled.	1
