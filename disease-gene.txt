It was found that 96.8% and 72.4% of patients present with @GENE$ level and @DISEASE$, respectively, and 70.6% of kidney recipients patients presented with high creatinine levels.	1
On laboratory evaluation, many patients present with @DISEASE$ and increased @GENE$, which are both associated with inferior outcomes.	1
The commonest laboratory abnormalities were raised @GENE$ or procalcitonin (54.0%), @DISEASE$ (34.2%) and elevated transaminases (16.0%).	1
Further, the @DISEASE$ patients whose illness entered 7-10 days, age &gt; 50 years, and elevated @GENE$ levels should be given additional medical considerations.	1
An high @GENE$ value and abnormalities of chest X-ray (@DISEASE$) were detected in 26.2% and 19% of patients, respectively.	1
However, @GENE$ could not predict the recovery of @DISEASE$.	1
Mortality was associated with those that were admitted to ICU (19% vs 0; p=0.009), mechanically ventilated (31% vs 0; p=0.001), had @DISEASE$ (20% vs 2.3%; p=0.032), older (62 vs 47 years; p=0.045), had high total bilirubin (43% vs 2.3%; p=0.007) and those with high @GENE$ (186 vs 90mg/dL; p=0.009) and low corrected calcium (15% vs 0%; p=0.047).	1
Insights into @GENE$ structure-function relationships have uncovered both pro- and anti-inflammatory isoforms that may be used to monitor the extent of tissue damage associated with @DISEASE$ pathologies and prognoses.	1
Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts, elevated levels of @GENE$ and @DISEASE$, confirming the viral origin of the disease.	1
@DISEASE$ (&lt;1.0 × 10 cells/L) was identified in 6 of 10 patients, 9 of 9 patients had a high serum level of D-dimer, and 9 of 9 patients had a high level of @GENE$.	1
A higher proportion of PLH group needed inpatient services (19.31% vs 11.39%, RR 1.696, 95% CI: 1.21 - 2.38).Mean @GENE$, ferritin, ESR and LDH levels after @DISEASE$ diagnosis were not statistically different and mortality was not different for PLH with history of anti-retroviral treatment.	1
Thombocytosis, @DISEASE$, and increased @GENE$ were common lab findings although most patients included in the overall analysis did not have laboratory values reported.	1
As the worsening of severity, the positive rates of @GENE$ and @DISEASE$ also showed trends of increase.	1
Different @GENE$/@DISEASE$ type showed associations with viral loads in patients in different severity and different time after onset.	1
Most of them had several comorbidities, and all had multiple biological abnormalities (@DISEASE$, increased @GENE$, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, liver enzymes).	1
ROC curves showed a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 70% for the LDH cut-off value of 450 U/L and a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 71% for the @GENE$ cut-off value of 11 mg/dl in identifying CoVID-19 with moderate-severe @DISEASE$.	1
The pooled area under the @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ curves were 0.70 (0.64-0.76) and 0.89 (0.80-0.99), respectively.	1
There was an important gain in oxygenation (P/F 300), a decrease of @GENE$ values, and a decrease of the @DISEASE$.	1
Compared with the common type, there was significant difference in the white blood cell and lymphocyte counts in the severe type (P&lt;0.01); the @DISEASE$ indicators, such as hypersensitivity @GENE$ and serum ferritin, were significantly increased, with significant difference (all P&lt;0.01); but the procalcitonin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was not significantly different (both P&gt;0.05).	1
At baseline, all patients had multiple biological abnormalities (@DISEASE$, increased @GENE$, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer and liver enzymes).	1
Multivariable regression demonstrated increasing odds of severity associated with the duration of @DISEASE$ (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.10-1.82, per day increase; p=0·007), @GENE$ (1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52; p=0.02), and PO2 &lt;80 mmHg (28.07, 95% CI 1.50-524.12; p=0.026) on admission.	1
First-in-Man: Case Report of Selective @GENE$ Apheresis in a Patient with @DISEASE$.	1
CONCLUSIONS This is the first report on @GENE$ apheresis in a @DISEASE$ patient.	1
The signature of @DISEASE$ was combined with five indicators, namely neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin, older age, and @GENE$.	1
Males were more likely to have liver injury when infected with @DISEASE$ (P &lt; .05); compared with patients without liver injury, patients with liver injury had increased levels of white blood cell counts, neutrophils, @GENE$ and CT score (P &lt; .05) and had a longer length of stay (P &lt; .05).	1
Mild patients had low to moderate @DISEASE$ (&lt;39.1 °C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased @GENE$.	1
The levels of @GENE$ and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest a typical @DISEASE$.	1
We aimed to assess the usefulness of @GENE$ levels in the early stage of @DISEASE$ and to correlate them with lung lesions and severe presentation.	1
In the early stage of @DISEASE$ @GENE$ levels were positively correlated with lung lesions and could reflect disease severity.	1
Abnormal white blood cell counts have poor sensitivity for @DISEASE$; procalcitonin and @GENE$ levels, when available, are more informative.	1
The aim of the present study was to estimate whether the @GENE$ level is able to act as a marker in indicating the severity of @DISEASE$.	1
@GENE$, procalcitonin, d-dimer, and @DISEASE$-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients.	1
In regard to the hematological parameters, @DISEASE$ patients showed decreased erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, and complement C1q, whereas neutrophils, @GENE$, and procalcitonin were significantly increased, especially in severe cases.	1
Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and @GENE$ were found in postpartum blood tests of @DISEASE$ patients.	1
Kinetics of temperature, @GENE$, and lymphocyte counts mirrored the remitting/relapsing @DISEASE$.	1
On admission, the levels of SpO2, lymphocyte, @GENE$, PCT, and LDH could predict the prognosis of severe @DISEASE$ patients.	1
During the second episode, there was serological evidence of elevated @GENE$ and @DISEASE$ IgG seroconversion.	1
Levels of @GENE$, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = 0.37, P = 0.003, Spearman's correlation) of patients who presented @DISEASE$.	1
Moreover, the change of @GENE$ level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of @DISEASE$.	1
Among the survivors versus non-survivors of @DISEASE$, there were significant differences in total leukocyte count (p&lt;0.001), neutrophil count, (p&lt;0.001), lymphocyte count (p&lt;0.001), urea (p&lt;0.001), serum bicarbonate (p=0.001), @GENE$ levels (p&lt;0.001), LDH (p=0.013), and D-dimer (p&lt;0.001) at admission.	1
In patients with @DISEASE$, admission @GENE$ correlated with disease severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse outcome.	1
The main laboratory findings were @DISEASE$ (33%) and elevated D-dimer (52%) and @GENE$ (40%) levels.	1
The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated @GENE$ (68.6% [58.2-78.2]), @DISEASE$ count (57.4% [44.8-69.5]) and increased lactate dehydrogenase (51.6% [31.4-71.6]).	1
@DISEASE$ and neutrophil count are frequently predictive in diagnostic models, while comorbidities, sex, @GENE$, and creatinine are frequent prognostic factors.	1
The combination of @DISEASE$ and elevated hs-@GENE$ yielded a sensitivity of 67·9% and specificity of 78·2% (AUC=0·730).	1
Patients transferred in ICU were more likely to have @DISEASE$, decreased SpO2 and increased D-dimer, @GENE$ and creatinine levels.	1
The corresponding AUC of @GENE$ and SAA values for severity of @DISEASE$ were 0.804 and 0.818, respectively.	1
Multiple regression analysis indicated that serum T: LH ratio was negatively associated with white blood cell counts and @GENE$ levels in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
Few parameters, such Lymphocytes count, SaO2 and @GENE$ serum level can be used to assess the severity of @DISEASE$ in emergency room.	1
In this multicenter retrospective cohort study we included adult patients with @DISEASE$, need of respiratory support, and elevated @GENE$ who received intravenous tocilizumab in addition to standard of care.	1
All had increased @GENE$ serum level and @DISEASE$.	1
Other common clinical features included hypoxia, chest crepitation, @DISEASE$ and high @GENE$.	1
Proteins associated with blood coagulation (D-dimer), cell damage (lactate dehydrogenase), and the inflammatory response (e.g., @GENE$) have already been identified as possible predictors of @DISEASE$ severity or mortality.	1
Herein, rationale is given for interpretation of @GENE$ blood levels as a simple, rapid, and cost-effective way to assess disease severity and help guide therapeutic options in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
@GENE$ values were also measured in patients with newly diagnosed @DISEASE$.	1
Laboratory studies showed hemoglobin (Hb) 5.1 g/dL, D-dimer 4.55 µg/mL, and @GENE$ 12.3 mg/dL. Computed tomography scan of the chest showed @DISEASE$ involving the bilateral lower lobe segmental branches.	1
Age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer and @GENE$ obtained on admission were identified as predictors of mortality for @DISEASE$ patients by LASSO.	1
The most common laboratory findings were elevated @GENE$ and @DISEASE$.	1
Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (@GENE$, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p &lt; 0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe @DISEASE$, non-White race, and mortality.	1
The survival curve analysis showed that higher @GENE$ (≥5mg/L) plus any other abnormalities of lymphocyte, blood urea nitrogen or lactate dehydrogenase significantly predicted poor prognosis of @DISEASE$ infected elderly patients.	1
A total of 268 patients was evaluated; intermediate care units (IMCUs, 61%), sub-intensive care units (SICUs, 8%), intensive care units (ICUs, 17%) and rehabilitation units (RUs, 14%): BMI: &lt;18.5, 9% (higher in RUs, p = 0.008) and ≥30, 13% (higher in ICUs, p = 0.012); WL ≥ 5%, 52% (higher in ICUs and RUs, p = 0.001); @GENE$ &gt;0.5: 78% (higher in ICUs and lower in RUs, p &lt; 0.001); Nutritional risk and @DISEASE$ were present in 77% (higher in ICUs and RUs, p &lt; 0.001) and 50% (higher in ICUs, p = 0.0792) of the patients, respectively.	1
Among patients with negative initial chest radiographs, age ≥ 45 years (odds ratio [OR]: 3.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.76-8.75, p = 0.001), absolute lymphocyte count &lt; 1500 cells/μL (OR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.03-4.89, p = 0.041), and @GENE$ &gt; 0.5 mg/dL (OR: 3.91, 95% CI: 1.54-9.91, p = 0.004) were independent predictors for future development of @DISEASE$.	1
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed NLR and @GENE$ were independent risk factors for severe @DISEASE$.	1
D-dimer and @GENE$ Blood Levels Over Time Used to Predict Pulmonary Embolism in Two @DISEASE$ Patients.	1
And although lymphocyte, D-dimer and @GENE$ levels did not demonstrate diagnostic value, all indicate severity of @DISEASE$.	1
Elevated level of @GENE$ may be an early marker to predict risk for severity of @DISEASE$.	1
@DISEASE$ related indicators such as WBC#, N#, L#, hs-@GENE$ showed no differences.	1
Patients with imaging progression were prone to be advanced in age [years: 60 (46-65) v 47 (37-60.75), P = 0.030]; @DISEASE$ (66.7% v 40.4%, P = 0.042) and low level of @GENE$ [mg/L: 5.7 (1.9-20.2) v 18.9 (6.7-38.9), P = 0.038].	1
@GENE$ correlates with computed tomographic findings and predicts severe @DISEASE$ early.	1
@GENE$ in severe @DISEASE$ patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.	1
Trends observed by serial laboratory measurements during hospitalization including progressive decrease of lymphocyte count, @DISEASE$, elevated @GENE$, procalcitonin, increased liver enzymes, decreased renal function, and coagulation derangements were more common in critically ill patient groups and associated with a high incidence of clinical complications.	1
@GENE$, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and ferritin in severe @DISEASE$: a meta-analysis.	1
Elevated @GENE$ was associated with an increased composite poor outcome [risk ratio (RR) 1.84 (1.45, 2.33), p &lt; 0.001; I2: 96%] and its severe @DISEASE$ (RR 1.41; I2: 93%) subgroup.	1
Subsequently, the @DISEASE$ improved without antipyretics and her @GENE$ level decreased rapidly.	1
A @DISEASE$ count and an increased high-sensitivity @GENE$ level were the most common laboratory findings.	1
None of them had @DISEASE$ after tocilizumab treatment and the levels of @GENE$ (13.08 ± 12.89) were almost within normal limits.	1
@GENE$ Level May Predict the Risk of @DISEASE$ Aggravation.	1
The incidence of progression from severe to @DISEASE$, 28-day mortality, clinical symptom improvement, time to clinical symptom improvement, hematologic indicators including @GENE$, lymphocyte number, and interleukin 6, and imaging changes were observed and compared between the two groups.	1
Blood parameters showed @DISEASE$ in 345/418 (83%) of cases and a high @GENE$ in 587/626 (94%).	1
Correlation analysis showed that the @DISEASE$ index value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, @GENE$, procalcitonin, days from illness onset, and body temperature (P &lt; 0.05).	1
Among the 5 patients, 2 had @DISEASE$ (2/5, 40%), 1 had low absolute neutrophil counts (1/5, 20%), and 2 had increased high-sensitivity @GENE$ (2/5, 40%).	1
Many studies have reported the clinical characteristics of @DISEASE$: sudden deterioration of disease around 1-2 weeks after onset; much lower level of lymphocytes, especially natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood; extremely high pro-inflammatory cytokines and @GENE$ (CRP).	1
High @GENE$ and D-dimer levels were the parameters most frequently associated with severe @DISEASE$.	1
@GENE$ (HR, 1.164 per mg/dL; 95% CI, 1.006-1.347; p = 0.041) was independently associated with CEFS in the mild @DISEASE$ group (n = 54).	1
From 1 April 2020, patients with @DISEASE$-associated CSS, defined as rapid respiratory deterioration plus at least two out of three biomarkers with important elevations (@GENE$ &gt;100 mg/L; ferritin &gt;900 µg/L; D-dimer &gt;1500 µg/L), received high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 5 consecutive days (250 mg on day 1 followed by 80 mg on days 2-5).	1
Prognostic value of @GENE$ in patients with @DISEASE$.	1
@GENE$ was also an independent discriminator of severe/@DISEASE$ on admission (AUC 0.783, z=10.69, p&lt;0.001).	1
Higher biological markers of inflammation (@GENE$: 28 ± 39 vs. 98 ± 97 mg/L, p = .04), of fibrinolysis (D-dimer: 804 ± 1,500 vs. 3,128 ± 2,458 μg/L, p = .02), and antiphospholipid antibodies in four cases were observed in the @DISEASE$ group.	1
Lymphocyte-to-@GENE$ Ratio: A Novel Predictor of Adverse Outcomes in @DISEASE$.	1
Patients with TCZ (n=20) had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (5.3 [±2.4] vs 3.4 [±2.6], P=0.014), presented with more severe forms (higher level of oxygen therapy at 13L/min vs 6L/min, P&lt;0.001), and had poorer biological findings (severe @DISEASE$: 676/mm3 vs 914/mm3, P=0.037 and higher @GENE$ level: 158mg/L vs 105mg/L, P=0.017) than patients without TCZ (n=25).	1
In univariate analyses, we also found that patients who died from @DISEASE$ had higher hyperinflammation markers than patients who survived: @GENE$ (181 (IQR 120-220) vs 107.4 (IQR 30-150; p 0.05); lactate dehydrogenase (641.8 (IQR 465.75-853.5) vs 361 (IQR 250-450), p 0.03); serum ferritin (1026 (IQR 228.3-1536.3) vs 861.3 (IQR 389-1490.5), p 0.04); D-dimer (12,019.8 (IQR 843.5-25,790.5) vs 1544.3 (IQR 619-1622), p 0.04).	1
@DISEASE$ (median, 0.77 x 103 per mm3; IQR, 0.58-1.00 x 103 per mm3), hyperinflammation with @GENE$ (median, 184.5 mg/dL; IQR, 108.2-269.1 mg/dL) and pro-coagulant status with D-dimer (median, 10.1 μg/m; IQR, 5.0-23.8 μg/m) were present.	1
Increased @GENE$ level, @DISEASE$ count, and increased D-dimer level were the most common laboratory findings.	1
LDH and @GENE$ may be related to respiratory function (PaO2/FiO2) and be a predictor of @DISEASE$ in CoVID-19 patients.	1
We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of @DISEASE$ and @GENE$.	1
@DISEASE$ and @GENE$ on arrival may predict poor outcomes.	1
The effect of anakinra was rapid, as judged by significant decrease of @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ at day 3.	1
@GENE$ is a useful marker to monitor @DISEASE$ in SOT.	1
This study revealed that the risk factors for the death in these elderly patients included comorbidities, increased levels of @GENE$ and blood urea nitrogen, and @DISEASE$ during hospitalization.	1
The risk factors of neutrophil count, hypersensitivity @GENE$, creatine kinase, and blood urea nitrogen could help clinicians to early identify @DISEASE$ severe patients with poor outcomes on admission.	1
Elevated levels of @GENE$ was found in all of them and the majority of them had evidence of @DISEASE$; intensive care admissions were needed in 12 (63%) and vasoactive medications were given to 6 (31.5%) children.	1
@GENE$ may help to identify patients with @DISEASE$ who are at greater risk of dying during hospitalization.	1
Moreover, the levels of @GENE$ (153.6 (80.3, 240.7) ng/L vs. 49.8 (15.9, 101.9) ng/L) and N-terminal @DISEASE$-type natriuretic peptide (852.0 (400.0, 2 315.3) ng/L vs. 197.0 (115.3, 631.0) ng/L) were significantly higher than patients without myocardial injury (all P&lt;0.01).	1
@DISEASE$ and marked elevation of the @GENE$ observed in four (13.3%) and 12 (40%) cases, respectively.	1
There were 14 patients (87.5%) with normal or decreased white blood cell count, 11 patients (68.75%) with @DISEASE$ count, 15 patients (93.75%) with increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 13 patients (81.25%) with increased hypersensitivity @GENE$, 5 patients (31.25%) with increased procalcitonin, and 8 patients (50%) with increased serum ferritin in peripheral blood, and stool routine was basically normal.	1
The laboratory and radiological characteristics of two groups mainly were @DISEASE$, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased @GENE$, increased lactate dehydrogenase, decreased oxygenation index, normal white blood cell count and bilateral chest CT involvement.	1
Early detection of elevations in serum @GENE$, combined with a clinical @DISEASE$ symptom presentation may be used as a surrogate marker for the presence and severity of the disease.	1
An increase in D-dimer blood levels and a decrease in @GENE$ blood levels over time may be used as a novel method to predict pulmonary embolism in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
Frequent laboratory findings were: elevated @GENE$ and @DISEASE$.	1
And although lymphocyte, D-dimer and @GENE$ levels did not demonstrate diagnostic value, all indicate severity of @DISEASE$.	1
Normal leukocyte counts (69.7%), @DISEASE$ (56.5%), elevated @GENE$ levels (73.6%), elevated ESR (65.6%), and oxygenation index decreased (63.6%) were observed in most patients.	1
Serum @GENE$ levels increase with increasing frequency of FQRS in patients with @DISEASE$ indicating that patients with FQRS are exposed to more inflammation.	1
The leukocyte, lymphocyte, and thrombocyte count and @GENE$ levels were lowest in the @DISEASE$ group (p&lt;0.001, p=0.04, p&lt;0.001, p=0.007 respectively).	1
In addition, @DISEASE$ patients showed higher mean platelet volume, lower @GENE$ concentrations, and higher De Ritis ratio.	1
The improvement of LYM and @GENE$ may be associated with the prognoses of @DISEASE$.	1
The two cases with severe illness had profound @DISEASE$ with markedly elevated @GENE$, procalcitonin, and ferritin.	1
Therefore, it is imperative to closely monitor laboratory parameters including the WBC count, LYMPH count, and @GENE$, along with other imaging features in chest CT scans, to promptly prevent, diagnose, and treat a @DISEASE$ during pregnancy.	1
Patients with @DISEASE$ had higher peak inflammatory markers like @GENE$ 184 (111-258) versus 142 (65-229) p = 0.012 and peak LDH 560 (384-758) versus 499 (324-655) p = 0.017.	1
Patients exhibited @DISEASE$ and elevated inflammatory markers, including @GENE$ and ferritin.	1
The @GENE$, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of @DISEASE$ assessed on initial CT (Rrange, 0.36-0.75; P &lt; 0.05).	1
This meta-analysis showed that an elevated serum @GENE$, PCT, D-dimer, and ferritin were associated with a poor outcome in @DISEASE$.	1
The CXR score showed a significant positive correlation with @GENE$, lactate dehydrogenase, and @DISEASE$ duration, and a negative correlation with oxygen saturation.	1
Signature score differences in laboratory and CT imaging features between subgroups were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05); @DISEASE$ was negatively correlated with GLCM Entropy_angle 90_offset4 (r=-0.578), but was positively correlated with ShortRunEmphhasis_AllDirect_offset4_SD (r=0.454); @GENE$ was positively correlated with Cluster Prominence_ AllDirect_offset 4_ SD (r=0.47).	1
The proportion of ground glass opacity (GGO), @DISEASE$ and the total lesion based on the quantitative method was positively correlated with the semi-quantitative CT score (P &lt; 0.001 for all; rs = 0.88, 0.87, 0.90), @GENE$ (P = 0.0278, 0.0168, 0.0078; rs = 0.40, 0.43, 0.48) and ESR (P = 0.0296, 0.0408, 0.0048; rs = 0.46, 0.44, 0.58), respectively, and was negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count (P = 0.0222, 0.0024, 0.0068; rs = -0.42, -0.53, -0.48).	1
Our results demonstrated that the nomogram and Combined Index calculated from the NLR and @GENE$ are potential and reliable predictors of @DISEASE$ prognosis and can triage patients at the time of admission.	1
In addition, they were more likely to have increased inflammatory response and @DISEASE$ as reflected in @GENE$ (51.1 (1.3-127.9) vs 12.1 (0.1-212.0) mg/L, p&lt;0.05) and D-dimer (6.9 (0.3-20.0) vs 0.5 (0.1-20.0) mg/L, p&lt;0.001).	1
Admission to the PICU was significantly associated with higher @GENE$, procalcitonin, and @DISEASE$ type natriuretic peptide levels and platelet counts (P &lt; .05 for all).	1
Owing to 44-60% @DISEASE$ presentation, risk of the high inflammatory state, and coagulation cascade abnormalities reported in ECoVs, testing for @GENE$, serum creatine kinase, and D-dimer level is mandatory.	1
The @DISEASE$ (0.37 × 109/L [interquartile range: 0.23-0.65]) and increased @GENE$ (24.7 × 109/L [interquartile range: 13.57-38]) were observed.	1
In this multicenter retrospective study, routine laboratory parameters (@GENE$, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts), demographic data and the chest X-ray/CT result from 967 patients entering the ED with @DISEASE$ were collected.	1
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) peak values were correlated with risk of death (OR 1.007 [95% CI 1.002-1.01], P = 0.005) along with age, multiple comorbidities, @DISEASE$ , ICU admission and @GENE$.	1
Common laboratory features included @DISEASE$ [6/7 (86%)], elevated lactate dehydrogenase [3/4 (75%)], D-dimer [5/6 (83%)], high-sensitivity @GENE$ [4/4 (100%)] and procalcitonin [5/5 (100%)].	1
Seventeen factors were independently associated with an increased hazard of death, the strongest among them included advanced age, @DISEASE$, low age-adjusted oxygen saturation, higher concentrations of @GENE$, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate.	1
@DISEASE$ women had a higher BMI (p &lt; 0.001), systolic (p &lt; 0.0001) and diastolic (p &lt; 0.05) blood pressure, waist circumference (p &lt; 0.0001), testosterone (p &lt; 0.0001), free androgen index (p &lt; 0.0001) and @GENE$ (p &lt; 0.0001).	1
@DISEASE$ (59%) with elevated @GENE$ (70%) was observed and 91% of the women were delivered by cesarean section.	1
On multivariable analysis, age (per-year increase OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.10; p &lt; 0.001), @DISEASE$ (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.07-6.25; p 0.03), and @GENE$ levels (per-point increase OR 1.009; 95% CI 1.004-1.014; p 0.001) were independent risk factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality.	1
Marked elevation of cytokines/chemokines is observed with elevation of additional markers of inflammation, coagulation, and organ damage such as @GENE$, D-dimer, LDH, Ferritin and Troponin-I. This hyperinflammation leads to worsening of oxygen saturation due to pulmonary infiltration and exudation, organ damage, and dysfunction of coagulation pathway and may lead to multi-@DISEASE$.	1
Before regular treatments, the sum score of the opacities showed @DISEASE$ to moderate correlations with duration, @GENE$, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase levels (R ranged from 0.341-0.651, P &lt; .05).	1
Several laboratory markers (lower O2 saturation and platelets, and higher leukocytes, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, @GENE$, procalcitonin, and ferritin) were associated with @DISEASE$ severity.	1
Higher levels of @DISEASE$ indices (e.g. white blood cell count, neutrophil count, @GENE$ and procalcitonin) were observed in the elevated group.	1
There was a significant positive correlation between Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QTc ratio and @GENE$ in patients with newly diagnosed @DISEASE$ (rs = 0.332, p = .005, rs = 0.397, p &lt; .001 consecutively).	1
CONCLUSIONS Old age (&gt;70 years old), @GENE$ &gt;100 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase &gt;300 U/L, and lactic acid &gt;3 mmol/L are high-risk factors related to myocardial damage in critical patients with @DISEASE$.	1
Compared with the first hospitalization, there were significant decreases in @DISEASE$ (5 vs 0, P = .035), elevated levels of both white blood cell count (P = .036) and lymphocyte count (P = .002), remarkedly decreases in @GENE$ and serum amyloid A (P &lt; .05) in the second hospitalization.	1
Higher levels of NLR and @GENE$ at admission were associated with poor prognosis of individuals with moderate @DISEASE$.	1
ROC curve analysis revealed that the AUC of age, @GENE$ and lymphocyte count for @DISEASE$ were 0.873, 0.911 and 0.817, respectively.	1
Laboratory findings are nonspecific; @DISEASE$, elevation of @GENE$ and procalcitonin have been described.	1
We suggest that higher, possibly therapeutic levels of anticoagulation might be mandatory for a further subset of patients with @DISEASE$ where a discrepant evolution of @GENE$ and D-dimer is observed.	1
A meta-analysis of seven studies with 1905 patients showed that increased @GENE$ (OR 3.0, 95% CI: 2.1-4.4), @DISEASE$ (OR 4.5, 95% CI: 3.3-6.0), and increased LDH (OR 6.7, 95% CI: 2.4-18.9) were significantly associated with severity.	1
The assessment of serum biochemical and blood hematological factors showed that there was a strong correlation between @DISEASE$ intensity and high serum Cr, BUN, and ALT levels, high @GENE$ concentration, and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts in male KTRs.	1
Data were collected on age, sex, physical ability, rehabilitation modality (remote/direct), need for intubation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, degree of @DISEASE$, oxygen therapy from the start of rehabilitation, D-dimer and @GENE$ levels, and rehabilitation-related complications.	1
The elderly and patients with higher level of @GENE$ were more likely to experience a severe outcome of @DISEASE$.	1
@GENE$ levels in the early stage of @DISEASE$.	1
Among all univariable parameters, lymphocytes, @GENE$, and LDH were significantly independent risk factors of @DISEASE$ severity.	1
To investigate the value of the combined detection of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and @GENE$ level (CRP) in the diagnosis of @DISEASE$.	1
Importantly, @GENE$, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe @DISEASE$.	1
Laboratory findings included elevated @GENE$ (57%) and @DISEASE$ (50%).	1
Visceral fat (VAT) was significantly higher in patients requiring intensive care (p = 0.032), together with age (p = 0.009), inflammation markers @GENE$ and LDH (p &lt; 0.0001, p = 0.003, respectively), and @DISEASE$ severity as assessed by a Lung Severity Score (LSS) (p &lt; 0.0001).	1
Patients without @DISEASE$ still exhibited mild illness and had elevated SAA levels but not @GENE$ levels.	1
For patients with elevated levels of both SAA and @GENE$, and a high NLR, a @DISEASE$ was predicted, requiring medical attention.	1
Therefore, @GENE$ and SAA levels demonstrate a prognostic value for predicting the severity of @DISEASE$.	1
Most of the liver function indexes in @DISEASE$ patients were correlated with @GENE$ and NLR, the markers of inflammation.	1
1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), @GENE$ level &gt;200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level &gt;2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with @DISEASE$ than age or comorbidities.	1
The following parameters were comparable including lymphocyte counts, @GENE$, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, bilateral involvement in chest CT (76.9% vs. 71.9%), worsening of @DISEASE$ (15.4% vs. 9.4%), favorable outcome (92.3% vs. 96.9%) between ACEI/ARB group and non-ACEI/ARB group respectively (all P&gt;0.05).	1
During the prenatal and postpartum period, there was no difference in the count of WBC, Neutrophils and Lymphocyte, the radio of Neutrophils and Lymphocyte and the level of @GENE$ between the confirmed @DISEASE$ group and the control group(p&lt;0.05).	1
@GENE$ and D-dimer levels positively correlated with severe @DISEASE$ and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio decreased as the patients improved clinically.	1
Moreover, the smooth curve fitting graph reflected that the severity of @DISEASE$ was positively correlated with both age and @GENE$ levels (all P value &lt; 0.05).	1
@DISEASE$ were positively related to @GENE$ levels but negatively related to sleep quality.	1
In the multivariate regression, @DISEASE$ (odds ratio [OR], 8.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.81-44.42; P = 0.007), CT score &gt; 5 (OR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.44-9.53; P = 0.007), old age (&gt; 77 years, OR, 9.96; 95% CI, 3.78-26.28; P &lt; 0.001), and elevated @GENE$ (OR, 4.15; 95% CI, 1.62-10.6; P = 0.003) were significant prognostic factors of severe disease.	1
The prognostic value of admission @GENE$ was evaluated in patients with @DISEASE$.	1
Receiver operating characteristic analysis concluded LDH (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.875), D-dimer (AUC: 0.803), and PCT (AUC: 0.769) were superior biomarkers to ferritin (AUC: 0.714) and @GENE$ (AUC: 0.711) in predicting the fatality of @DISEASE$.	1
Logistic regression indicated that SAA and @GENE$ were independent risk factors for the severity of @DISEASE$.	1
24 patients (18 symptomatic, 6 asymptomatic) with confirmed @DISEASE$ by polymerase chain reaction underwent bedside ChUS in addition to @GENE$ following admission.	1

Inhaled @GENE$ 125 μg twice daily for 5 days in addition to standard care.	1
@DISEASE$ has been detected in the @GENE$ of some patients.	1
None of the patients had MRI features of @DISEASE$ nor significant @GENE$ abnormalities.	1
The specific @DISEASE$ RNA was not detected in the nasopharyngeal swab but was detected in a @GENE$.	1

In total, 113 hypertensive Covid-19 patients were included, of them 74 patients were using @GENE$ inh/@DISEASE$.	1
In a multivariable analysis, the use of @GENE$ inh/@DISEASE$ was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR: 3.66; 95%CI: 1.11-18.18; p= .032).	1
Older @DISEASE$-affected patients with cardiovascular comorbidities exhibit a more severe clinical course and a worse prognosis, with many of them being also treated with ARBs or @GENE$-Is.	1

@DISEASE$ replicates in TF-bearing epithelial and endothelial cells and may stimulate and integrate host cell @GENE$, like HSV1 and other known coagulopathic viruses.	1
Additionally, the generation of antiphospholipid antibodies associated with @DISEASE$ may also promote an increase in @GENE$.	1
Meanwhile, the patients displayed dramatically elevated levels of serum inflammatory factors, while a markedly prolonged activated partial @GENE$ time (APTT) in critically ill patients reflected @DISEASE$.	1
@GENE$ also functions from within the nascent TF/FVIIa/FXa complex to trigger profound changes via protease-activated receptors (PARs) in many cell types, including @DISEASE$-trophic cells.	1
Therefore, aberrant expression of @GENE$ may be the underlying basis of @DISEASE$ symptoms.	1
Strikingly, envelope @GENE$ is essential for HSV1 @DISEASE$ in mice, and the FXa-directed oral anticoagulant apixaban had remarkable antiviral efficacy.	1
Bowles et al. have found that @DISEASE$ were positive in 91% of patients (n=34) with high activated partial @GENE$ time (aPTT).	1

The pooled WMD of AST and @GENE$ in severe vs. mild @DISEASE$ were 12.23 (95% CI; 8.07, 16.39; p &lt; 0.01) and 8.07 (95% CI 2.55, 11.91; p &lt; 0.01), respectively.	1
When compared between severe and non-severe @DISEASE$ patients, the pooled ORs of elevated @GENE$, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were 2.35 (95% CI 1.38-3.98), 3.21 (95% CI 2.59-3.98), 1.87 (95% CI 1.32-2.65), and 4.83 (95% CI 2.90-8.05), respectively.	1

Additionally, a significantly elevated hemoglobin A1c (@GENE$c) signified undiagnosed @DISEASE$.	1
BNP level showed positive correlation with @GENE$c (r = 0.49, p = 0.04) and negative correlation with delta pO2 (r = -0.52, p = 0.04) can predict reduced microvascular compliance due to @DISEASE$ contributing to hypoxia susceptibility in healthy individuals.	1
Random plasma glucose at 12 weeks, and fasting plasma glucose or @GENE$c at 28 weeks identify women with @DISEASE$ at risk of suboptimal pregnancy outcomes.	1
This was a retrospective study of @DISEASE$ patients who underwent an @GENE$c test.	1
The population was composed by 63.2% female individuals, age median of 66 years, @DISEASE$ duration 10.7 ± 8.2 years and @GENE$c 7.7 ± 1.9% (61 + 20.8 mmol/mol).	1
@GENE$c is a biomarker with a central role in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with @DISEASE$, although not a perfect one.	1
We undertook a meta-analysis on the screening and diagnostic accuracy of the haemoglobin A1c (@GENE$c) test in women with and without risk factors for @DISEASE$.	1
Overall (n = 120), participants had a mean age of 54.8 ± 14.4 years-old, and @GENE$c of 9.0 ± 1.6% (75 ± 17.5 mmol/mol); 93% of patients showed signs of current @DISEASE$ based on the surveys measured.	1
There is a growing body of evidence on the accuracy of @GENE$c as a screening and diagnostic test for @DISEASE$.	1
A higher @GENE$c was associated with referable @DISEASE$.	1

Is @GENE$c an ideal biomarker of well-controlled @DISEASE$?	1
A simulation model was created using glycemic data from previous disasters (taken as similar in impact to current lockdown) taking baseline @GENE$c and @DISEASE$ data from India-specific database.	1
@GENE$c is more useful as a specific test at a cut-off of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) with a false positive rate of 10%, but should be supplemented by a more sensitive test to detect women with @DISEASE$.	1

@GENE$-induced changes in monocyte metabolism by @DISEASE$ directly inhibit T cell response and reduce epithelial cell survival.	1
These frequencies were higher than those found in uninfected @GENE$*02:01+ donors (∼2.5 × 10-6), but low when compared to frequencies for @DISEASE$-specific (A2/M158) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific (A2/BMLF1280) (∼1.38 × 10-4) populations.	1
When alleles were examined simultaneously using a multiple regression model to control for confounding factors, @GENE$*44 and C*01 were still positively and independently associated with @DISEASE$: a growth rate of 16% (95%CI: 0.1-35%) per 1% point increase in B*44 prevalence; and of 19% (95%CI: 1-41%) per 1% point increase in C*01 prevalence.	1
@GENE$ multifunctionality is commonly associated with the presence of flexible or disordered regions, we analyze here the intrinsic disorder predisposition of major players related to the @DISEASE$ - RAAS axis.	1
Conversely, we found that @GENE$*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved @DISEASE$ peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting that it could enable cross-protective T-cell-based immunity.	1
We also looked at which immune dominant regions of @DISEASE$ and other coronaviruses are recognized by Major Histocompatibility Complex (@GENE$)/Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) genes and how this could impact on subsequent disease pathogenesis.	1
Our epidemiologic analysis, despite the limits of the ecological approach, is strongly suggestive of a permissive role of @GENE$*01 and B*44 towards @DISEASE$, which warrants further investigation in case-control studies.	1
These viral antigens can be either recognized by the B cells or presented by @GENE$ complexes to the T cells, resulting in antibody production, increased cytokine secretion, and cytolytic activity in the acute phase of @DISEASE$.	1
The association of @GENE$ alleles and its downregulated expression has been correlated with disease severity against @DISEASE$ and coronaviruses.	1
Since @DISEASE$ restrains antigen presentation by downregulating @GENE$ class I and II molecules and, therefore, inhibits the T cell-mediated immune responses, humoral immune responses also play a substantial role.	1
In the context of specific immune response against the virus, a correlation between Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I (@GENE$-I) and the severity of the disease in patients with @DISEASE$ has been suggested.	1

@GENE$ 4-digit typing along with viral sequence analysis should be considered in studies examining clinical outcomes in patients with @DISEASE$.	1
The present study shows, by in silico analysis, that these common human viruses are expected to induce immune memory against @DISEASE$ by sharing protein fragments (antigen epitopes) for presentation to the immune system by @GENE$ class I. A list of such epitopes is provided.	1
We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, and Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of @DISEASE$ based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and @GENE$/paratope binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects.	1

We propose that subjects with @DISEASE$, old age, and male gender have the greatest morbidity and mortality and have low stress proteins, in particular, low intracellular heme oxygenase (@GENE$), making them particularly vulnerable to the disease.	1
The @GENE$ pathway can inhibit platelet aggregation, and can have anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties, amongst others, all of which are critical medical conditions observed in @DISEASE$ patients.	1
We therefore postulate that free heme contributes to many of the inflammatory phenomena witnessed in critically ill @DISEASE$ patients, whilst induction of @GENE$ or harnessing heme may provide protection.	1
Additionally, @DISEASE$'s heme reduction may contribute to even lower @GENE$.	1
Controlled trials of these @GENE$ inducers should be done in order to prevent or treat @DISEASE$ disease.	1

The results support a bifactor model consisting of one general factor and two specific factors-one of emotional fear reactions and another of somatic expressions of fear of @DISEASE$ (@GENE$ = 0.988, RMSEA = 0.075).	1
Given the significance of TLSs in mucosal immunity, their association with positive prognosis and response to immune checkpoint blockade with a critical role of Type I interferon (@GENE$) in inducing these, we also discuss potentiating TLS formation as a promising approach to enhance anti-@DISEASE$.	1
We propose that lessons learned from BCG immunotherapy success could be applied to not only augment such microbe-based therapeutics but also lead to similar adjunctive @GENE$ activating approaches to improve response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in @DISEASE$.	1
